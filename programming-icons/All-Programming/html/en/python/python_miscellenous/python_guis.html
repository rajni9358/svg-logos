<p>In this chapter, you will learn about some popular Python IDEs <strong>(Integrated Development Environment)</strong>, and how to use IDE for program development.</p>
<p>To use the scripted mode of Python, you need to save the sequence of Python instructions in a text file and save it with <strong>.py</strong> extension. You can use any text editor available on the operating system. Whenever the interpreter encounters errors, the source code needs to be edited and run again and again. To avoid this tedious method, IDE is used. An IDE is a one stop solution for typing, editing the source code, detecting the errors and executing the program.</p>
<h2>IDLE</h2>
<p>Python's standard library contains the <strong>IDLE</strong> module. IDLE stands for <strong>Integrated Development and Learning Environment</strong>. As the name suggests, it is useful when one is in the learning stage. It includes a Python interactive shell and a code editor, customized to the needs of Python language structure. Some of its important features include syntax highlighting, auto-completion, customizable interface etc.</p>
<p>To write a Python script, open a new text editor window from the File menu.</p>

<p>A new editor window opens in which you can enter the Python code. Save it and run it with Run menu.</p>

<h2>Jupyter Notebook</h2>
<p>Initially developed as a web interface for IPython, Jupyter Notebook supports multiple languages. The name itself derives from the alphabets from the names of the supported languages &minus; <strong>Ju</strong>lia, <strong>PYT</strong>hon and <strong>R</strong>. Jupyter notebook is a client server application. The server is launched at the localhost, and the browser acts as its client.</p>
<p>Install Jupyter notebook with PIP &minus;</p>

<p>Invoke from the command line.</p>

<p>The server is launched at localhost's 8888 port number.</p>

<p>The default browser of your system opens a link <strong>http://localhost:8888/tree</strong> to display the dashboard.</p>

<p>Open a new Python notebook. It shows IPython style input cell. Enter Python instructions and run the cell.</p>

<p>Jupyter notebook is a versatile tool, used very extensively by data scientists to display inline data visualizations. The notebook can be conveniently converted and distributed in PDF, HTML or Markdown format.</p>
<h2>VS Code</h2>
<p>Microsoft has developed a source code editor called VS Code <strong>(Visual Studio Code)</strong> that supports multiple languages including C++, Java, Python and others. It provides features such as syntax highlighting, autocomplete, debugger and version control.</p>
<p>VS Code is a freeware. It is available for download and install from <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://code.visualstudio.com/</a>.</p>
<p>Launch VS Code from the start menu (in Windows).</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/vs_code_window.jpg" alt="vs_code_window" /></p>
<p>You can also launch VS Code from command line &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">C<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\test<span class="token operator">&gt;</span>code <span class="token punctuation">.</span></div>
<p>VS Code cannot be used unless respective language extension is not installed. VS Code <strong>Extensions</strong> marketplace has a number of extensions for language compilers and other utilities. Search for Python extension from the Extension tab (Ctrl+Shift+X) and install it.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/vs_code_extensions.jpg" alt="VS_Code_Extensions" /></p>
<p>After activating Python extension, you need to set the Python interpreter. Press Ctrl+Shift+P and select Python interpreter.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/select_interpreter.jpg" alt="select_interpreter" /></p>
<p>Open a new text file, enter Python code and save the file.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/python_code_file.jpg" alt="python_code_file" /></p>
<p>Open a command prompt terminal and run the program.</p>

<h2>PyCharm</h2>
<p>PyCharm is another popular Python IDE. It has been developed by JetBrains, a Czech software company. Its features include code analysis, a graphical debugger, integration with version control systems etc. PyCharm supports web development with Django.</p>
<p>The community as well as professional editions can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/download</a>.</p>
<p>Download, install the latest Version: 2022.3.2 and open PyCharm. The Welcome screen appears as below &minus;</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/welcome_to_pycharm.jpg" alt="welcome_to_pycharm" /></p>
<p>When you start a new project, PyCharm creates a virtual environment for it based on the choice of folder location and the version of Python interpreter chosen.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/new_project.jpg" alt="new_project" /></p>
<p>You can now add one or more Python scripts required for the project. Here we add a sample Python code in main.py file.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/python_project.jpg" alt="python_project" /></p>
<p>To execute the program, choose from Run menu or use Shift+F10 shortcut.</p>
<p><img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/run_the_program.jpg" alt="run_the_program" /></p>
<p>Output will be displayed in the console window as shown below &minus;</p>
