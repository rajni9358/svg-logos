
<h1>Python - Overview</h1>
<p>Python is a high-level, multi-paradigm programming language. As Python is an interpreter-based language, it is easier to learn compared to some of the other mainstream languages. Python is a dynamically typed language with very intuitive data types.</p>
<p>Python is an open-source and cross-platform programming language. It is available for use under <strong>Python Software Foundation License</strong> (compatible to GNU General Public License) on all the major operating system platforms Linux, Windows and Mac OS.</p>
<p>The design philosophy of Python emphasizes on simplicity, readability and unambiguity. Python is known for its batteries included approach as Python software is distributed with a comprehensive standard library of functions and modules.</p>
<p>Python's design philosophy is documented in the <strong>Zen of Python</strong>. It consists of nineteen aphorisms such as &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Beautiful is better than ugly</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated</li>

<p>Python supports imperative, structured as well as object-oriented programming methodology. It provides features of functional programming as well.</p>
<h1>Python - History</h1>
<p><strong>Guido Van Rossum</strong>, a Dutch programmer, created Python programming language. In the late 80's, he had been working on the development of ABC language in a computer science research institute named <strong>Centrum Wiskunde &amp; Informatica</strong> (CWI) in the Netherlands. In 1991, Van Rossum conceived and published Python as a successor of ABC language.</p>
<p>For many uninitiated people, the word Python is related to a species of snake. Rossum though attributes the choice of the name Python to a popular comedy series "<strong>Monty Python's Flying Circus</strong>" on BBC.</p>
<p>Being the principal architect of Python, the developer community conferred upon him the title of "<strong>Benevolent Dictator for Life</strong> (BDFL). However, in 2018, Rossum relinquished the title. Thereafter, the development and distribution of the reference implementation of Python is handled by a nonprofit organization <strong>Python Software Foundation</strong>.</p>
<p>Important stages in the history of Python &minus;</p>
<h2>Python 0.9.0</h2>
<p>Python's first published version is 0.9. It was released in February 1991. It consisted of support for core object-oriented programming principles.</p>
<div class="inserted-div">&nbsp;</div>
<h2>Python 1.0</h2>
<p>In January 1994, version 1.0 was released, armed with functional programming tools, features like support for complex numbers etc.</p>
<h2>Python 2.0</h2>
<p>Next major version &minus; Python 2.0 was launched in October 2000. Many new features such as list comprehension, garbage collection and Unicode support were included with it.</p>
<h2>Python 3.0</h2>
<p>Python 3.0, a completely revamped version of Python was released in December 2008. The primary objective of this revamp was to remove a lot of discrepancies that had crept in Python 2.x versions. Python 3 was backported to Python 2.6. It also included a utility named as <strong>python2to3</strong> to facilitate automatic translation of Python 2 code to Python 3.</p>
<h2>EOL for Python 2.x</h2>
<p>Even after the release of Python 3, Python Software Foundation continued to support the Python 2 branch with incremental micro versions till 2019. However, it decided to discontinue the support by the end of year 2020, at which time Python 2.7.17 was the last version in the branch.</p>
<h2>Current Version</h2>
<p>Meanwhile, more and more features have been incorporated into Python's 3.x branch. As of date, Python <strong>3.11.2</strong> is the current stable version, released in February 2023.</p>
<h2>What's New in Python 3.11?</h2>
<p>One of the most important features of Python's version 3.11 is the significant improvement in speed. According to Python's official documentation, this version is faster than the previous version (3.10) by up to 60%. It also states that the standard benchmark suite shows a 25% faster execution rate.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>Python 3.11 has a better exception messaging. Instead of generating a long traceback on the occurrence of an exception, we now get the exact expression causing the error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As per the recommendations of PEP 678, the <strong>add_note()</strong> method is added to the BaseException class. You can call this method inside the except clause and pass a custom error message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It also adds the <strong>cbroot()</strong> function in the <strong>maths</strong> module. It returns the cube root of a given number.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A new module <strong>tomllib</strong> is added in the standard library. TOML (Tom's Obvious Minimal Language) can be parsed with tomlib module function.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Python - Features</h1>
<p>In this chapter, let's highlight some of the important features of Python that make it widely popular.</p>
<h2>Python is Easy to Learn</h2>
<p>This is one of the most important reasons for the popularity of Python. Python has a limited set of keywords. Its features such as simple syntax, usage of indentation to avoid clutter of curly brackets and dynamic typing that doesn't necessitate prior declaration of variable help a beginner to learn Python quickly and easily.</p>
<h2>Python is Interpreter Based</h2>
<p>Instructions in any programming languages must be translated into machine code for the processor to execute them. Programming languages are either compiler based or interpreter based.</p>
<p>In case of a compiler, a machine language version of the entire source program is generated. The conversion fails even if there is a single erroneous statement. Hence, the development process is tedious for the beginners. The C family languages (including C, C++, Java, C Sharp etc) are compiler based.</p>
<p>Python is an interpreter based language. The interpreter takes one instruction from the source code at a time, translates it into machine code and executes it. Instructions before the first occurrence of error are executed. With this feature, it is easier to debug the program and thus proves useful for the beginner level programmer to gain confidence gradually. Python therefore is a beginner-friendly language.</p>
<h2>Python is Interactive</h2>
<p>Standard Python distribution comes with an interactive shell that works on the principle of REPL (Read &minus; Evaluate &minus; Print &minus; Loop). The shell presents a Python prompt &gt;&gt;&gt;. You can type any valid Python expression and press Enter. Python interpreter immediately returns the response and the prompt comes back to read the next expression.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token operator">*</span><span class="token number">3</span><span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token number">7</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hello World"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> Hello World</div>
<p>The interactive mode is especially useful to get familiar with a library and test out its functionality. You can try out small code snippets in interactive mode before writing a program.</p>
<h2>Python is MultiParadigm</h2>
<p>Python is a completely object-oriented language. Everything in a Python program is an object. However, Python conveniently encapsulates its object orientation to be used as an imperative or procedural language &minus; such as C. Python also provides certain functionality that resembles functional programming. Moreover, certain third-party tools have been developed to support other programming paradigms such as aspect-oriented and logic programming.</p>
<h2>Python's Standard Library</h2>
<p>Even though it has a very few keywords (only Thirty Five), Python software is distributed with a standard library made of large number of modules and packages. Thus Python has out of box support for programming needs such as serialization, data compression, internet data handling, and many more. Python is known for its batteries included approach.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/python_important_features.jpg" alt="Python Important Features" />
<h2>Python is Open Source and Cross Platform</h2>
<p>Python's standard distribution can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.python.org/downloads/</a> without any restrictions. You can download pre-compiled binaries for various operating system platforms. In addition, the source code is also freely available, which is why it comes under open source category.</p>
<p>Python software (along with the documentation) is distributed under Python Software Foundation License. It is a BSD style permissive software license and compatible to GNU GPL (General Public License).</p>
<p>Python is a cross-platform language. Pre-compiled binaries are available for use on various operating system platforms such as Windows, Linux, Mac OS, Android OS. The reference implementation of Python is called CPython and is written in C. You can download the source code and compile it for your OS platform.</p>
<p>A Python program is first compiled to an intermediate platform independent byte code. The virtual machine inside the interpreter then executes the byte code. This behaviour makes Python a cross-platform language, and thus a Python program can be easily ported from one OS platform to other.</p>
<h2>Python for GUI Applications</h2>
<p>Python's standard distribution has an excellent graphics library called TKinter. It is a Python port for the vastly popular GUI toolkit called TCL/Tk. You can build attractive user-friendly GUI applications in Python. GUI toolkits are generally written in C/C++. Many of them have been ported to Python. Examples are PyQt, WxWidgets, PySimpleGUI etc.</p>
<h2>Python's Database Connectivity</h2>
<p>Almost any type of database can be used as a backend with the Python application. DB-API is a set of specifications for database driver software to let Python communicate with a relational database. With many third party libraries, Python can also work with NoSQL databases such as MongoDB.</p>
<h2>Python is Extensible</h2>
<p>The term extensibility implies the ability to add new features or modify existing features. As stated earlier, CPython (which is Python's reference implementation) is written in C. Hence one can easily write modules/libraries in C and incorporate them in the standard library. There are other implementations of Python such as Jython (written in Java) and IPython (written in C#). Hence, it is possible to write and merge new functionality in these implementations with Java and C# respectively.</p>
<h2>Python's Active Developer Community</h2>
<p>As a result of Python's popularity and open-source nature, a large number of Python developers often interact with online forums and conferences. Python Software Foundation also has a significant member base, involved in the organization's mission to "promote, protect, and advance the Python programming language"</p>
<p>Python also enjoys a significant institutional support. Major IT companies Google, Microsoft, and Meta contribute immensely by preparing documentation and other resources.</p>
<h1>Python vs C++</h1>
<p>Both Python and C++ are among the most popular programming languages. Both of them have their advantages and disadvantages. In this chapter, we shall take a look at their characteristic features.</p>
<h2>Compiled vs Interpreted</h2>
<p>Like C, C++ is also a compiler-based language. A compiler translates the entire code in a machine language code specific to the operating system in use and processor architecture.</p>
<p>Python is interpreter-based language. The interpreter executes the source code line by line.</p>
<h2>Cross platform</h2>
<p>When a C++ source code such as hello.cpp is compiled on Linux, it can be only run on any other computer with Linux operating system. If required to run on other OS, it needs to be compiled.</p>
<p>Python interpreter doesn't produce compiled code. Source code is converted to byte code every time it is run on any operating system without any changes or additional steps.</p>
<h2>Portability</h2>
<p>Python code is easily portable from one OS to other. C++ code is not portable as it must be recompiled if the OS changes.</p>
<h2>Speed of Development</h2>
<p>C++ program is compiled to the machine code. Hence, its execution is faster than interpreter based language.</p>
<p>Python interpreter doesn't generate the machine code. Conversion of intermediate byte code to machine language is done on each execution of program.</p>
<p>If a program is to be used frequently, C++ is more efficient than Python.</p>
<h2>Easy to Learn</h2>
<p>Compared to C++, Python has a simpler syntax. Its code is more readable. Writing C++ code seems daunting in the beginning because of complicated syntax rule such as use of curly braces and semicolon for sentence termination.</p>
<p>Python doesn't use curly brackets for marking a block of statements. Instead, it uses indents. Statements of similar indent level mark a block. This makes a Python program more readable.</p>
<h2>Static vs Dynamic Typing</h2>
<p>C++ is a statically typed language. The type of variables for storing data need to be declared in the beginning. Undeclared variables can't be used. Once a variable is declared to be of a certain type, value of only that type can be stored in it.</p>
<p>Python is a dynamically typed language. It doesn't require a variable to be declared before assigning it a value. Since, a variable may store any type of data, it is called dynamically typed.</p>
<h2>OOP Concepts</h2>
<p>Both C++ and Python implement object oriented programming concepts. C++ is closer to the theory of OOP than Python. C++ supports the concept of data encapsulation as the visibility of the variables can be defined as public, private and protected.</p>
<p>Python doesn't have the provision of defining the visibility. Unlike C++, Python doesn't support method overloading. Because it is dynamically typed, all the methods are polymorphic in nature by default.</p>
<p>C++ is in fact an extension of C. One can say that additional keywords are added in C so that it supports OOP. Hence, we can write a C type procedure oriented program in C++.</p>
<p>Python is completely object oriented language. Python's data model is such that, even if you can adapt a procedure oriented approach, Python internally uses object-oriented methodology.</p>
<h2>Garbage Collection</h2>
<p>C++ uses the concept of pointers. Unused memory in a C++ program is not cleared automatically. In C++, the process of garbage collection is manual. Hence, a C++ program is likely to face memory related exceptional behavior.</p>
<p>Python has a mechanism of automatic garbage collection. Hence, Python program is more robust and less prone to memory related issues.</p>
<h2>Application Areas</h2>
<p>Because C++ program compiles directly to machine code, it is more suitable for systems programming, writing device drivers, embedded systems and operating system utilities.</p>
<p>Python program is suitable for application programming. Its main area of application today is data science, machine learning, API development etc.</p>

<h1>Python - Hello World Program</h1>
<p>Hello World program is a basic computer code written in a general purpose programming language, used as a test program. It doesn't ask for any input and displays a Hello World message on the output console. It is used to test if the software needed to compile and run the program has been installed correctly.</p>
<p>It is very easy to display the Hello World message using the Python interpreter. Launch the interpreter from a command terminal of your operating system and issue the print statement from the Python prompt as follows &minus;</p>

<p>Similarly, Hello World message is printed in Linux.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">mvl@GNVBGL3<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token operator">~</span>$ python3 Python <span class="token number">3.10</span><span class="token number">.6</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>main<span class="token punctuation">,</span> Mar <span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token number">2023</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token number">55</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token number">28</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>GCC <span class="token number">11.3</span><span class="token number">.0</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> on linux Type <span class="token string">"help"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"copyright"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"credits"</span> <span class="token keyword">or</span> <span class="token string">"license"</span> <span class="token keyword">for</span> more information<span class="token punctuation">.</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hello World"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> Hello World</div>
<p>Python interpreter also works in scripted mode. Open any text editor, enter the following text and save as Hello.py</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hello World"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>For Windows OS, open the command prompt terminal (CMD) and run the program as shown below &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">C<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\Python311<span class="token operator">&gt;</span>python hello<span class="token punctuation">.</span>py Hello World</div>
<p>The terminal shows the Hello World message.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/hello_world.jpg" alt="hello world" />
<p>While working on Ubuntu Linux, you have to follow the same steps, save the code and run from Linux terminal. We use vi editor for saving the program.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/run_on_linux_terminal.jpg" alt="run on linux terminal" />
<p>To run the program from Linux terminal</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">mvl@GNVBGL3<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token operator">~</span>$ python3 hello<span class="token punctuation">.</span>py Hello World</div>
<p>In Linux, you can convert a Python program into a self executable script. The first statement in the code should be a shebang. It must contain the path to Python executable. In Linux, Python is installed in /usr/bin directory, and the name of the executable is python3. Hence, we add this statement to hello.py file</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">#!/usr/bin/python3
print ("Hello World")
</pre>
<p>You also need to give the file executable permission by using the chmod +x command</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">mvl@GNVBGL3:~$ chmod +x hello.py
</pre>
<p>Then, you can run the program with following command line &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">mvl@GNVBGL3:~$ ./hello.py
</pre>
<p>The <strong>output</strong> is shown below &minus;</p>
<img src="/python/images/output_hello_world.jpg" alt="output hello world" />
<p>Thus, we can write and run Hello World program in Python using the interpreter mode and script mode.</p>
<h1>Python - Application Areas</h1>
<p>Python is a general-purpose programming language. It is suitable for development of wide range of software applications. Over last few years Python is the preferred language of choice for developers in following application areas &minus;</p>
<h2>Python for Data Science</h2>
<p>Python's recent meteoric rise in the popularity charts is largely due its Data science libraries. Python has become an essential skill for data scientists. Today, real time web applications, mobile applications and other devices generate huge amount of data. Python's data science libraries help companies generate business insights from this data.</p>
<p>Libraries like NumPy, Pandas and Matplotlib are extensively used to apply mathematical algorithms to the data and generate visualizations. Commercial and community Python distributions like Anaconda and ActiveState bundle all the essential libraries required for data science.</p>
<h2>Python for Machine Learning</h2>
<p>Python libraries such as Scikit-learn and TensorFlow help in building models for prediction of trends like customer satisfaction, projected values of stocks etc. based upon the past data. Machine learning applications include (but not restricted to) medical diagnosis, statistical arbitrage, basket analysis, sales prediction etc.</p>
<h2>Python for Web Development</h2>
<p>Python's web frameworks facilitate rapid web application development. Django, Pyramid, Flask are very popular among the web developer community. etc. make it very easy to develop and deploy simple as well as complex web applications.</p>
<p>Latest versions of Python provide asynchronous programming support. Modern web frameworks leverage this feature to develop fast and high performance web apps and APIs.</p>
<h2>Python for Computer Vision and Image processing</h2>
<p>OpenCV is a widely popular library for capturing and processing images. Image processing algorithms extract information from images, reconstruct image and video data. Computer Vision uses image processing for face detection and pattern recognition. OpenCV is a C++ library. Its Python port is extensively used because of its rapid development feature.</p>
<p>Some of the application areas of computer vision are robotics, industrial surveillance and automation, biometrics etc.</p>
<h2>Python for Embedded Systems and IoT</h2>

<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/python_coding_ground.jpg" alt="python_coding_ground.jpg" />
<h1>Python - Interpreter</h1>
<p>Python is an interpreter-based language. In a Linux system, Python's executable is installed in <strong>/usr/bin/</strong> directory. For Windows, the executable (python.exe) is found in the installation folder (for example <strong>C:\python311</strong>). In this chapter, you will <strong>how Python interpreter works</strong>, its interactive and scripted mode.</p>
<p>Python code is executed by one statement at a time method. Python interpreter has two components. The translator checks the statement for syntax. If found correct, it generates an intermediate byte code. There is a Python virtual machine which then converts the byte code in native binary and executes it. The following diagram illustrates the mechanism:</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/python_interpreter.jpg" alt="Python Interpreter" />
<p>Python interpreter has an interactive mode and a scripted mode.</p>
<h3>Interactive Mode</h3>
<p>When launched from a command line terminal without any additional options, a Python prompt <strong>&gt;&gt;&gt;</strong> appears and the Python interpreter works on the principle of <strong>REPL (Read, Evaluate, Print, Loop)</strong>. Each command entered in front of the Python prompt is read, translated and executed. A typical interactive session is as follows.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> price <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">100</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> qty <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">5</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> ttl <span class="token operator">=</span> price<span class="token operator">*</span>qty <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> ttl <span class="token number">500</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Total = "</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> ttl<span class="token punctuation">)</span> Total <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">500</span></div>
<p>To close the interactive session, enter the end-of-line character (ctrl+D for Linux and ctrl+Z for Windows). You may also type <strong>quit()</strong> in front of the Python prompt and press Enter to return to the OS prompt.</p>
<p>The interactive shell available with standard Python distribution is not equipped with features like line editing, history search, auto-completion etc. You can use other advanced interactive interpreter software such as <strong>IPython</strong> and <strong>bpython</strong>.</p>
<h3>Scripting Mode</h3>
<p>Instead of entering and obtaining the result of one instruction at a time &minus; as in the interactive environment, it is possible to save a set of instructions in a text file, make sure that it has <strong>.py</strong> extension, and use the name as the command line parameter for Python command.</p>
<p>Save the following lines as <strong>prog1.py</strong>, with the use of any text editor such as vim on Linux or Notepad on Windows.</p>

</pre>
<p>Note that even though Python executes the entire script, it is still executed in one-by-one fashion.</p>
<p>In case of any compiler-based language such as Java, the source code is not converted in byte code unless the entire code is error-free. In Python, on the other hand, statements are executed until first occurrence of error is encountered.</p>
<p>Let us introduce an error purposefully in the above code.</p>

<p>Note that the statements before the erroneous statement are executed and then the error message appears. Thus it is now clear that Python script is executed in interpreted manner.</p>
<p>In addition to executing the Python script as above, the script itself can be a selfexecutable in Linux, like a shell script. You have to add a <strong>shebang</strong> line on top of the script. The shebang indicates which executable is used to interpret Python statements in the script. Very first line of the script starts with <strong>#!</strong> And followed by the path to Python executable.</p>
<p>Modify the prog1.py script as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>IPython</h3>
<p>IPython (stands for <strong>Interactive Python</strong>) is an enhanced and powerful interactive environment for Python with many functionalities compared to the standard Python shell. IPython was originally developed by Fernando Perez in 2001.</p>
<p>IPython has the following important features &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>IPython's object introspection ability to check properties of an object during runtime.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its syntax highlighting proves to be useful in identifying the language elements such as keywords, variables etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The history of interactions is internally stored and can be reproduced.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tab completion of keywords, variables and function names is one of the most important features.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IPython's Magic command system is useful for controlling Python environment and performing OS tasks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is the main kernel for Jupyter notebook and other front-end tools of Project Jupyter.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Install IPython with PIP installer utility.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">pip3 install ipython</div>

<p>Instead of the regular &gt;&gt;&gt; prompt as in standard interpreter, you will notice two major IPython prompts as explained below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>In[1] appears before any input expression.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Out[1]appears before the Output appears.</p>

<p>Tab completion is one of the most useful enhancements provided by IPython. IPython pops up appropriate list of methods as you press tab key after dot in front of object.</p>
<p>In the following example, a string is defined. Press tab key after the "." symbol and as a response, the attributes of string class are shown. You can navigate to the required one.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/example.jpg" alt="example" />
<p>IPython provides information (introspection) of any object by putting '?' in front of it. It includes docstring, function definitions and constructor details of class. For example to explore the string object var defined above, in the input prompt enter var?.</p>

<p>Jupyter notebook is a web-based interface to programming environments of Python, Julia, R and many others. For Python, it uses IPython as its main kernel.</p>
<h1>Python - Environment Setup</h1>
<p>First step in the journey of learning Python is to install it on your machine. Today most computer machines, especially having Linux OS, have Python pre-installed. However, it may not be the latest version.</p>
<p>In this section, we shall learn to install the latest version of Python, <strong>Python 3.11.2</strong>, on Linux, Windows and Mac OS.</p>
<p>Latest version of Python for all the operating system environments can be downloaded from PSF's official website.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/psfs_official_website.jpg" alt="PSFs_official_website" />
<h3>Install Python on Ubuntu Linux</h3>
<p>To check whether Python is already installed, open the Linux terminal and enter the following command &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">user@ubuntu20<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token operator">~</span>$ python3 <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token operator">-</span>version</div>
<p>In Ubuntu Linux, the easiest way to install Python is to use <strong>apt &minus; Advanced Packaging Tool</strong>. It is always recommended to update the list of packages in all the configured repositories.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">user@ubuntu20<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token operator">~</span>$ sudo apt update</div>
<p>Even after the update, the latest version of Python may not be available for install, depending upon the version of Ubuntu you are using. To overcome this, add the <strong>deadsnakes</strong> repository.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">user@ubuntu20<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token operator">~</span>$ sudo apt<span class="token operator">-</span>get install software<span class="token operator">-</span>properties<span class="token operator">-</span>common user@ubuntu20<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token operator">~</span>$ sudo add<span class="token operator">-</span>apt<span class="token operator">-</span>repository ppa<span class="token punctuation">:</span>deadsnakes<span class="token operator">/</span>ppa</div>

<h3>Install Python on Windows</h3>
<p>It may be noted that Python's version 3.10 onwards cannot be installed on Windows 7 or earlier operating systems.</p>
<p>The recommended way to install Python is to use the official installer. Linn to the latest stable version is given on the home page itself. It is also found at <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.python.org/downloads/windows/.</a></p>
<p>You can find embeddable packages and installers for 32 as well as 64-bit architecture.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/embeddable_packages.jpg" alt="embeddable_packages" />
<p>Let us download 64-bit Windows installer &minus;</p>
<p>(<a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.2/python-3.11.2-amd64.exe" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.2/python-3.11.2-amd64.exe</a>)</p>
<p>Double click on the file where it has been downloaded to start the installation.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/installation.jpg" alt="Image-9.jpg" />
<p>Although you can straight away proceed by clicking the Install Now button, it is advised to choose the installation folder with a relatively shorter path, and tick the second check box to update the PATH variable.</p>
<p>Accept defaults for rest of the steps in this installation wizard to complete the installation.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/complete_installation.jpg" alt="Image-10" />
<p>Open the Window Command Prompt terminal and run Python to check the success of installation.</p>

<p>Python's standard library has an executable module called <strong>IDLE</strong> &minus; short for <strong>Integrated Development and Learning Environment</strong>. Find it from Window start menu and launch.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/idle.jpg" alt="idle" />
<p>IDLE contains Python shell (interactive interpreter) and a customizable multi-window text editor with features such as syntax highlighting, smart indent, auto completion etc. It is cross-platform so works the same on Windows, MacOS and Linux. It also has a debugger with provision to set breakpoints, stepping, and viewing of global and local namespaces.</p>
<h2>Install Python on MacOS</h2>
<p>Earlier versions of MacOS used to have Python 2.7 pre-installed in it. However, now that the version no longer supported, it has been discontinued. Hence, you need to install Python on your own.</p>
<p>On a Mac computer, Python can be installed by two methods &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>Using the official installer</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Manual installation with homebrew</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>You can find macOS 64-bit universal2 installer on the downloads page of the official website &minus;</p>

<p>The installation process is more or less similar to that on Windows. Usually, accepting the default options during the wizard steps should do the work.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/installation_process.jpg" alt="installation_process" />
<p>The frequently required utilities such as PIP and IDLE are also installed by this installation wizard.</p>
<p>Alternately, you can opt for the installation from command line. You need to install <strong>Homebrew</strong>, Mac's package manager, if it is not already available. You can follow the instructions for installation at <a href="https://docs.brew.sh/Installation" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://docs.brew.sh/Installation.</a></p>
<p>After that, open the terminal and enter the following commands &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">brew update <span class="token operator">&amp;</span><span class="token operator">&amp;</span> brew upgrade brew install python3</div>
<p>Latest version of Python will now be installed.</p>
<h2>Install Python from Source Code</h2>
<p>If you are an experienced developer, with good knowledge of C++ and Git tool, you can follow the instructions in this section to build Python executable along with the modules in the standard library.</p>
<p>You must have the C compiler for the OS that you are on. In Ubuntu and MacOS, <strong>gcc</strong> compiler is available. For Windows, you should install Visual Studio 2017 or later.</p>
<h3>Steps to Build Python on Linux/Mac</h3>
<p>Download the source code of Python's latest version either from Python's official website or its GitHub repository.</p>
<p>Download the source tarball : <a href="https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.2/Python3.11.2.tgz" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.11.2/Python3.11.2.tgz</a></p>
<p>Extract the files with the command &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">tar <span class="token operator">-</span>xvzf <span class="token operator">/</span>home<span class="token operator">/</span>python<span class="token operator">/</span>Python<span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token number">.2</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span>tgz</div>
<p>Alternately, clone the main branch of Python's GitHub repository. (You should have git installed)</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">git clone <span class="token operator">-</span>b main https<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token operator">//</span>github<span class="token punctuation">.</span>com<span class="token operator">/</span>python<span class="token operator">/</span>cpython</div>
<p>A configure script comes in the source code. Running this script will create the makefile.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token operator">/</span>configure <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token operator">-</span>enable<span class="token operator">-</span>optimizations</div>
<p>Followed by this, use the make tool to build the files and then make install to put the final files in /usr/bin/ directory.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">make make install</div>
<p>Python has been successfully built from the source code.</p>
<p>If you use Windows, make sure you have <strong>Visual Studio 2017</strong> and <strong>Git for Windows</strong> installed. Clone the Python source code repository by the same command as above.</p>
<p>Open the windows command prompt in the folder where the source code is placed. Run the following batch file</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">PCbuild\get_externals<span class="token punctuation">.</span>bat</div>
<p>This downloads the source code dependencies (OpenSSL, Tk etc.)</p>
<p>Open Visual Studio and <strong>PCbuild/sbuild.sln</strong> solution, and build (press F10) the debug folder shows <strong>python_d.exe</strong> which is the debug version of Python executable.</p>
<p>To build from command prompt, use the following command &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">PCbuild\build<span class="token punctuation">.</span>bat <span class="token operator">-</span>e <span class="token operator">-</span>d <span class="token operator">-</span>p x64</div>
<p>Thus, in this chapter, you learned how to install Python from the pre-built binaries as well as from the source code.</p>
<h3>Setting Up the PATH</h3>
<p>When the Python software is installed, it should be accessible from anywhere in the file system. For this purpose, the <strong>PATH</strong> environment variable needs to be updated. A system PATH is a string consisting of folder names separated by <strong>semicolon (;)</strong>. Whenever an executable program is invoked from the command line, the operating system searches for it in the folders listed in the PATH variable. We need to append Python's installation folder to the PATH string.</p>
<p>In case of Windows operating system, if you have enabled "add python.exe to system path" option on the first screen of the installation wizard, the path will be automatically updated. To do it manually, open Environment Variables section from Advanced System Settings.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/setting_up_the_path.jpg" alt="setting up the path" />
<p>Edit the Path variable, and add a new entry. Enter the name of the installation folder in which Python has been installed, and press OK.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/edit_the_path_variable.jpg" alt="edit the path variable" />
<p>To add the Python directory to the path for a particular session in Linux &minus;</p>
<p><strong>In the bash shell (Linux)</strong> &minus; type <strong>export PATH="$PATH:/usr/bin/python3.11"</strong> and press Enter.</p>
<h2>Python Command Line Options</h2>
<p>We know that interactive Python interpreter can be invoked from the terminal simply by calling Python executable. Note that no additional parameters or options are needed to start the interactive session.</p>

<p>Python interpreter also responds to the following command line options &minus;</p>
<h3>-c &lt;command&gt;</h3>
<p>Interpreters execute one or more statements in a string, separated by newlines (;) symbol.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">user@ubuntu20<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token operator">~</span>$ python3 <span class="token operator">-</span>c <span class="token string">"a=2;b=3;print(a+b)"</span> <span class="token number">5</span></div>
<h3>-m &lt;module-name&gt;</h3>
<p>Interpreter executes the contents of named module as the __main__ module. Since the argument is a module name, you must not give a file extension (.py).</p>
<p>Consider the following example. Here, the timeit module in standard library has a command line interface. The -s option sets up the arguments for the module.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">C<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\Users\Acer<span class="token operator">&gt;</span>python <span class="token operator">-</span>m timeit <span class="token operator">-</span>s "text <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'sample string'</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> char <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">'g'</span> <span class="token string">'char in text'</span>" <span class="token number">5000000</span> loops<span class="token punctuation">,</span> best of <span class="token number">5</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">49.4</span> nsec per loop</div>
<h3>&lt;script&gt;</h3>
<p>Interpreter executes the Python code contained in script with .py extension, which must be a filesystem path (absolute or relative).</p>
<p>Assuming that a text file with the name hello.py contains print ("Hello World") statement is present in the current directory. The following command line usage of script option.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">C<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\Users\Acer<span class="token operator">&gt;</span>python hello<span class="token punctuation">.</span>py Hello World</div>
<h3>? Or -h or &minus;help</h3>
<p>This command line option prints a short description of all command line options and corresponding environment variables and exit.</p>
<h3>-V or --version</h3>
<p>This command line option prints the Python version number</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">C<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\Users\Acer<span class="token operator">&gt;</span>python <span class="token operator">-</span>V Python <span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token number">.2</span> C<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\Users\Acer<span class="token operator">&gt;</span>python <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token operator">-</span>version Python <span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token number">.2</span></div>
<h2>Python Environment Variables</h2>
<p>The operating system uses path environment variable to search for any executable (not only Python executable). Python specific environment variables allow you to configure the behaviour of Python. For example, which folder locations to check to import a module. Normally Python interpreter searches for the module in the current folder. You can set one or more alternate folder locations.</p>
<p>Python environment variables may be set temporarily for the current session or may be persistently added in the System Properties as in case of path variable.</p>
<h3>PYTHONPATH</h3>
<p>As mentioned above, if you want the interpreter should search for a module in other folders in addition to the current, one or more such folder locations are stored as PYTHONPATH variable.</p>
<p>First, save <strong>hello.py</strong> script in a folder different from Python's installation folder, let us say <strong>c:\modulepath\hello.py</strong></p>
<p>To make the module available to the interpreter globally, set PYTHONPATH</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">C<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\Users\Acer<span class="token operator">&gt;</span><span class="token builtin">set</span> PYTHONPATH<span class="token operator">=</span> c<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\modulepath C<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\Users\Acer<span class="token operator">&gt;</span>echo <span class="token operator">%</span>PYTHONPATH<span class="token operator">%</span> c<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\modulepath</div>
<p>Now you can import the module even from any directory other than c:\modulepath directory.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">import</span> hello Hello World <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<h3>PYTHONHOME</h3>
<p>Set this variable to change the location of the standard Python libraries. By default, the libraries are searched in <strong>/usr/local/pythonversion</strong> in case of Linux and <strong>instalfolder\lib</strong> in Windows. For example, <strong>c:\python311\lib</strong>.</p>
<h3>PYTHONSTARTUP</h3>
<p>Usually, this variable is set to a Python script, which you intend to get automatically executed every time Python interpreter starts.</p>
<p>Let us create a simple script as follows and save it as <strong>startup.py</strong> in the Python installation folder &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Example of Start up file"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hello World"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>Now set the PYTHONSTARTUP variable and assign name of this file to it. After that start the Python interpreter. It shows the output of this script before you get the prompt.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">F<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\<span class="token number">311_2</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span><span class="token builtin">set</span> PYTHONSTARTUP<span class="token operator">=</span>startup<span class="token punctuation">.</span>py F<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\<span class="token number">311_2</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span>echo <span class="token operator">%</span>PYTHONSTARTUP<span class="token operator">%</span> startup<span class="token punctuation">.</span>py F<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\<span class="token number">311_2</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span>python Python <span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token number">.2</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>tags<span class="token operator">/</span>v3<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token number">11.2</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span>878ead1<span class="token punctuation">,</span> Feb <span class="token number">7</span> <span class="token number">2023</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">16</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token number">38</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token number">35</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>MSC v<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token number">1934</span> <span class="token number">64</span> bit <span class="token punctuation">(</span>AMD64<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> on win32 Type <span class="token string">"help"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"copyright"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"credits"</span> <span class="token keyword">or</span> <span class="token string">"license"</span> <span class="token keyword">for</span> more information<span class="token punctuation">.</span> Example of Start up <span class="token builtin">file</span> Hello World <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<h3>PYTHONCASEOK</h3>
<p>This environment is available for use only on Windows and MacOSX, not on Linux. It causes Python to ignore the cases in import statement.</p>
<h3>PYTHONVERBOSE</h3>
<p>If this variable is set to a non-empty string it is equivalent to specifying python -v command. It results in printing a message, showing the place (filename or built-in module) each time a module is initialized. If set to an integer &minus; say 2, it is equivalent to specifying -v two times. (python --v).</p>
<h3>PYTHONDONTWRITEBYTECODE</h3>
<p>Normally, the imported modules are compiled to <strong>.pyc</strong> file. If this variable is set to a not null string,the .pyc files on the import of source modules are not created.</p>
<h3>PYTHONWARNINGS</h3>
<p>Python's warning messages are redirected to the standard error stream, <strong>sys.stderr</strong>. This environment variable is equivalent to the python -W option. The following are allowed values of this variable &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>PYTHONWARNINGS=default&emsp;# Warn once per call location</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PYTHONWARNINGS=error &emsp;# Convert to exceptions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PYTHONWARNINGS=always &emsp;# Warn every time</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PYTHONWARNINGS=module &emsp;# Warn once per calling module</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PYTHONWARNINGS=once &emsp;# Warn once per Python process</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>PYTHONWARNINGS=ignore &emsp;# Never warn</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Python - Virtual Environment</h1>
<p>In this chapter, you will get to know what a virtual environment in Python is, how to create and use a virtual environment for building a Python application.</p>
<p>When you install Python software on your computer, it is available for use from anywhere in the filesystem. This is a system-wide installation.</p>
<p>While developing an application in Python, one or more libraries may be required to be installed using the pip utility (e.g., <strong>pip3 install somelib</strong>). Moreover, an application (let us say App1) may require a particular version of the library &minus; say <strong>somelib 1.0</strong>. At the same time another Python application (for example App2) may require newer version of same library say <strong>somelib 2.0</strong>. Hence by installing a new version, the functionality of App1 may be compromised because of conflict between two different versions of same library.</p>
<p>This conflict can be avoided by providing two isolated environments of Python in the samemachine. These are called virtual environment. A virtual environment is a separatedirectory structure containing isolated installation having a local copy of Python interpreter, standard library and other modules.</p>
<p>The following figure shows the purpose of advantage of using virtual environment. Using the global Python installation, more than one virtual environments are created, each having different version of the same library, so that conflict is avoided.</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/python_virtual_environment.jpg" alt="python virtual environment" />
<p>This functionality is supported by <strong>venv</strong> module in standard Python distribution. Use following commands to create a new virtual environment.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">C<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\Users\Acer<span class="token operator">&gt;</span>md\pythonapp C<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\Users\Acer<span class="token operator">&gt;</span>cd\pythonapp C<span class="token punctuation">:</span>\pythonapp<span class="token operator">&gt;</span>python <span class="token operator">-</span>m venv myvenv</div>

<h1>Python - Basic Syntax</h1>
<p>In Python, the term syntax refers to the rules of forming a statement or expression. Python language is known for its clean and simple syntax. It also has a limited set of keywords and simpler punctuation rules as compared to other languages. In this chapter, let us understand about basic syntax of Python.</p>
<p>A Python program comprises of predefined keywords and identifiers representing functions, classes, modules etc. Python has clearly defined rules for forming identifiers, writing statements and comments in Python source code.</p>
<h2>Python Keywords</h2>
<p>A predefined set of keywords is the most important aspect of any programming language. These keywords are reserved words. They have a predefined meaning, they must be used only for its predefined purpose and as per the predefined rules of syntax. Programming logic is encoded with these keywords.</p>
<p>As of Python 3.11 version, there are 35 (Thirty Five) keywords in Python. To obtain the list of Python keywords, enter the following help command in Python shell.</p>

<p>How to verify if any word is a keyword or not? Most Python IDEs provide coloured syntax highlighting feature, where keywords are represented in a specific colour.</p>
<p>Shown below is a Python code in VS Code. Keywords (if and else), identifiers and constants appear in distinct colour scheme.</p>
<img src="/python/images/vs_code.jpg" alt="vs_code" />
<p>The keyword module also has a iskeyword() function. It returns True for a valid keyword, False otherwise.</p>

<p>We shall learn about the usage of each of these keywords as we go along in this tutorial.</p>
<h2>Python Identifiers</h2>
<p>Various elements in a Python program, other than keywords, are called identifiers. An identifier is a user-given name to variables, functions, classes, modules, packages etc. in the source code. Python has laid down certain rules to form an identifier. These rules are &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>An identifier should start with either an alphabet (lower or upper case) or underscore (_). More than one alpha-numeric characters or underscores may follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of any keyword as n identifier is not allowed, as keywords have a predefined meaning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Conventionally, name of class begins with uppercase alphabet. Other elements like variable or function start with lowercase alphabet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>As per another Python convention, single underscore in the beginning of a variable name is used to indicate a private variable.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use two underscores in beginning of identifier indicates that the variable is strongly private.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Two leading and trailing underscores are used in language itself for special purpose. For example, __add__, __init__</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>According to the above rules, here are some valid identifiers &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Student</li>
<li>score</li>
<li>aTotal</li>
<li>sum_age</li>
<li>__count</li>
<li>TotalValue</li>
<li>price1</li>
<li>cost_of_item</li>
<li>__init__</li>
</ul>
<p>Some invalid formations of identifiers are also given below &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>1001</li>
<li>Name of student</li>
<li>price-1</li>
<li>ft.in</li>
</ul>
<p>It may be noted that identifiers are case sensitive. As a result, Name and name are two different identifiers.</p>
<h2>Python Indents</h2>
<p>Use of indents in code is one of the important features of Python's syntax. Often in a program, you might require grouping more than one statements together as a block. For example, in case of more than one statements if a condition is true/false. Different programming languages have different methods to mark the scope and extent of group of statements in constructs like class, function, conditional and loop. C, C++, Java etc. make use of curly brackets to mark the block. Python uses uniform indentation to mark block of statements, thereby it increases the readability of the code.</p>
<p>To mark the beginning of a block, type the ":" symbol and press Enter. Any Python-aware editor (like IDLE, or VS Code) goes to the next line leaving additional whitespace (called indent). Subsequent statements in the block follow same level of indent. To signal end of the block, the whitespace is dedented by pressing the backspace key. The following example illustrates the use of indents in Python:</p>
<img src="/python/images/python_indents.jpg" alt="python_indents" />
<p>At this juncture, you may not understand how the code works. But don't worry. Just see how indent level increases after colon symbol.</p>
<h2>Python Statements</h2>
<p>A statement in Python is any instruction that the Python interpreter can execute. A statement comprises of one or more keywords, operators, identifiers, a : symbol to mark beginning of block, or backslash \ as continuation character.</p>
<p>The statement may be a simple assignment statement such as amount = 1000 or it may be a compound statement with multiple statements grouped together in uniformly indented block, as in conditional or looping constructs.</p>
<p>You can enter a statement in front of the Python prompt of the interactive shell, or in the editor window. Usually, text terminated by Enter key (called newline character) is recognized as a statement by Python interpreter. Hence, each line in the editor is a statement, unless it starts with the comment character (#).</p>

<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"My first program"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> price <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">100</span> qty <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">5</span> ttl <span class="token operator">=</span> price<span class="token operator">*</span>qty <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Total = "</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> ttl<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
</div>
<p>Each line in the above code is a statement. Occasionally, a Python statement may spill over multiple lines. To do so, use backslash (\) as continuation character. A long string can be conveniently broken in multiple lines as shown below &minus;</p>

<p>The continuation character also helps in writing a long arithmetic expression in a more readable manner.</p>

<p>The use of back-slash symbol (\) is not necessary if items in a list, tuple or dictionary object spill over multiple lines.</p>

<h1>Python - Variables</h1>
<p>In this chapter, you will learn what are variables in Python and how to use them.</p>
<p>Data items belonging to different data types are stored in computer's memory. Computer's memory locations are having a number or address, internally represented in binary form. Data is also stored in binary form as the computer works on the principle of binary representation. In the following diagram, a string <strong>May</strong> and a number <strong>18</strong> is shown as stored in memory locations.</p>
<img src="/python/images/memory.jpg" alt="memory" />
<p>If you know the assembly language, you will covert these data items and the memory address, and give a machine language instruction. However, it is not easy for everybody. Language translator such as Python interpreter performs this type of conversion. It stores the object in a randomly chosen memory location. Python's built-in <strong>id()</strong> function returns the address where the object is stored.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token string">"May"</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">id</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"May"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token number">2167264641264</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token number">18</span> <span class="token number">18</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">id</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">18</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token number">140714055169352</span></div>
<p>Once the data is stored in the memory, it should be accessed repeatedly for performing a certain process. Obviously, fetching the data from its ID is cumbersome. High level languages like Python make it possible to give a suitable alias or a label to refer to the memory location.</p>
<p>In the above example, let us label the location of May as month, and location in which 18 is stored as age. Python uses the assignment operator (=) to bind an object with the label.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> month<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"May"</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> age<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">18</span></div>
<p>The data object (May) and its name (month) have the same id(). The id() of 18 and age are also same.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">id</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>month<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token number">2167264641264</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">id</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>age<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token number">140714055169352</span></div>
<p>The label is an identifier. It is usually called as a variable. A Python variable is a symbolic name that is a reference or pointer to an object.</p>
<h2>Naming Convention</h2>
<p>Name of the variable is user specified, and is formed by following the rules of forming an identifier.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>Name of Python variable should start with either an alphabet (lower or upper case) or underscore (_). More than one alpha-numeric characters or underscores may follow.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Use of any keyword as Python variable is not allowed, as keywords have a predefined meaning.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Name of a variable in Python is case sensitive. As a result, age and Age cannot be used interchangeably.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You should choose the name of variable that is mnemonic, such that it indicates the purpose. It should not be very short, but not vary lengthy either.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If the name of variable contains multiple words, we should use these naming patterns &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p><strong>Camel case</strong> &minus; First letter is a lowercase, but first letter of each subsequent word is in uppercase. For example: kmPerHour, pricePerLitre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Pascal case</strong> &minus; First letter of each word is in uppercase. For example: KmPerHour, PricePerLitre</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Snake case</strong> &minus; Use single underscore (_) character to separate words. For example: km_per_hour, price_per_litre</p>

<p>Once you use a variable to identify a data object, it can be used repeatedly without its id() value. Here, we have a variables height and width of a rectangle. We can compute the area and perimeter with these variables.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> width<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> height<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">20</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> area<span class="token operator">=</span>width<span class="token operator">*</span>height <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> area <span class="token number">200</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> perimeter<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">2</span><span class="token operator">*</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>width<span class="token operator">+</span>height<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> perimeter <span class="token number">60</span></div>
<p>Use of variables is especially advantageous when writing scripts or programs. Following script also uses the above variables.</p>

<h2>Assignment Statement</h2>
<p>In languages such as C/C++ and Java, one needs to declare the variable and its type before assigning it any value. Such prior declaration of variable is not required in Python.</p>
<p>Python uses = symbol as the assignment operator. Name of the variable identifier appears on the left of = symbol. The expression on its right id evaluated and the value is assigned to the variable. Following are the examples of assignment statements</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> counter <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> counter <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token comment"># integer assignment</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> price <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">25.50</span> <span class="token comment"># float assignment</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> city <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token string">"Hyderabad"</span> <span class="token comment"># String assignment</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> subjects <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">"Physics"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Maths"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"English"</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token comment"># List assignment</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> mark_list <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token string">"Rohit"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token number">50</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Kiran"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token number">60</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Lata"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token number">70</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token comment"># dictionary</span> assignment</div>
<p>Python's built-in <strong>print()</strong> function displays the value of one or more variables.</p>

<p>Value of any expression on the right of = symbol is assigned to the variable on left.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">5</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> y <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> z <span class="token operator">=</span> x<span class="token operator">+</span>y</div>
<p>However, the expression on the left and variable on the right of = operator is not allowed.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">&gt;&gt;&gt; x = 5
&gt;&gt;&gt; y = 10
&gt;&gt;&gt; x+y=z
   File "&lt;stdin&gt;", line 1
   x+y=z
   ^^^
SyntaxError: cannot assign to expression here. Maybe you meant '=='
instead of '='?
</pre>
<p>Though z=x+y and x+y=z are equivalent in Mathematics, it is not so here. It's because = is an equation symbol, while in Python it is an assignment operator.</p>
<h2>Multiple Assignments</h2>
<p>In Python, you can initialize more than one variables in a single statement. In the following case, three variables have same value.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> b<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> c<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">10</span></div>
<p>Instead of separate assignments, you can do it in a single assignment statement as follows &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a<span class="token operator">=</span>b<span class="token operator">=</span>c<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">,</span>b<span class="token punctuation">,</span>c<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token number">10</span></div>
<p>In the following case, we have three variables with different values.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> b<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">20</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> c<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">30</span></div>
<p>These separate assignment statements can be combined in one. You need to give comma separated variable names on left, and comma separated values on the right of = operator.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a<span class="token punctuation">,</span>b<span class="token punctuation">,</span>c <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">30</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">,</span>b<span class="token punctuation">,</span>c<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token number">20</span> <span class="token number">30</span></div>
<p>The concept of variable works differently in Python than in C/C++.</p>
<p>In C/C++, a variable is a named memory location. If a=10 and also b=10, both are two different memory locations. Let us assume their memory address is 100 and 200 respectively.</p>
<img src="/python/images/named_memory_location.jpg" alt="named memory location" />
<p>If a different value is assigned to "a" &minus; say 50, 10 in the address 100 is overwritten.</p>
<img src="/python/images/different_value_assigned.jpg" alt="Image-20" />
<p>A Python variable refers to the object and not the memory location. An object is stored in memory only once. Multiple variables are really the multiple labels to the same object.</p>
<img src="/python/images/address_100.jpg" alt="address_100" />
<p>The statement a=50 creates a new <strong>int</strong> object 50 in the memory at some other location, leaving the object 10 referred by "b".</p>
<img src="/python/images/address_150.jpg" alt="address_150" />
<p>Further, if you assign some other value to b, the object 10 remains unreferred.</p>
<img src="/python/images/address_200.jpg" alt="address_200" />
<p>Python's garbage collector mechanism releases the memory occupied by any unreferred object.</p>
<p>Python's identity operator <strong>is</strong> returns True if both the operands have same id() value.</p>

<h1>Python - Data Types</h1>
<p>Computer is a data processing device. Computer stores the data in its memory and processes it as per the given program. Data is a representation of facts about a certain object.</p>
<p>Some examples of data &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p><strong>Data of students</strong> &minus; name, gender, class, marks, age, fee etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data of books in library</strong> &minus; title, author, publisher, price, pages, year of publication etc.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Data of employees in an office</strong> &minus; name, designation, salary, department, branch, etc.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Data type represents a kind of value and determines what operations can be done on it. Numeric, non-numeric and Boolean (true/false) data are the most obvious data types. However, each programming language has its own classification largely reflecting its programming philosophy.</p>
<p>Python identifies the data by different data types as per the following diagram &minus;</p>
<img src="/python/images/data_types.jpg" alt="data_types" />
<p>Python's data model defines four main data types. They are Number, Sequence, Set and Dictionary (also called Mapping)</p>
<h2>Number Type</h2>
<p>Any data item having a numeric value is a number. There are Four standard number data types in Python. They are integer, floating point, Boolean and Complex. Each of them have built-in classes in Python library, called <strong>int, float, bool</strong> and <strong>complex</strong> respectively.</p>
<p>In Python, a number is an object of its corresponding class. For example, an integer number 123 is an object of <strong>int</strong> class. Similarly, 9.99 is a floating point number, which is an object of float class.</p>
<p>Python's standard library has a built-in function <strong>type()</strong>, which returns the class of the given object. Here, it is used to check the type of an integer and floating point number.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">123</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'int'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">9.99</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'float'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>The fractional component of a float number can also be represented in <strong>scientific</strong> format. A number -0.000123 is equivalent to its scientific notation 1.23E-4 (or 1.23e-4).</p>
<p>A complex number is made up of two parts &minus; <strong>real</strong> and <strong>imaginary</strong>. They are separated by '+' or '-' signs. The imaginary part is suffixed by 'j' which is the imaginary number. The square root of -1 (<span id="MathJax-Element-2-Frame" class="MathJax" style="position: relative;" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;merror&gt;&lt;mtext&gt;&amp;amp;bsol;sqrt{&amp;#x2212;1}&lt;/mtext&gt;&lt;/merror&gt;&lt;/math&gt;"><span id="MathJax-Span-3" class="math"><span id="MathJax-Span-4" class="noError" style="display: inline-block;">&amp;bsol;sqrt{&minus;1}</span></span><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML">&amp;bsol;sqrt{&minus;1}</span></span>), is defined as imaginary number. Complex number in Python is represented as x+yj, where x is the real part, and y is the imaginary part. So, 5+6j is a complex number.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">5</span><span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token number">6j</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'complex'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>A Boolean number has only two possible values, as represented by the keywords, <strong>True</strong> and <strong>False</strong>. They correspond to integer 1 and 0 respectively.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">True</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'bool'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">False</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'bool'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>With Python's arithmetic operators you can perform operations such as addition, subtraction etc.</p>
<h2>Sequence Types</h2>
<p>Sequence is a collection data type. It is an ordered collection of items. Items in the sequence have a positional index starting with 0. It is conceptually similar to an array in C or C++. There are three sequence types defined in Python. String, List and Tuple.</p>
<h2>Strings in Python</h2>
<p>A string is a sequence of one or more Unicode characters, enclosed in single, double or triple quotation marks (also called inverted commas). As long as the same sequence of characters is enclosed, single or double or triple quotes don't matter. Hence, following string representations are equivalent.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token string">'Welcome To TutorialsPoint'</span> <span class="token string">'Welcome To TutorialsPoint'</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token string">"Welcome To TutorialsPoint"</span> <span class="token string">'Welcome To TutorialsPoint'</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token triple-quoted-string string">'''Welcome To TutorialsPoint'''</span> <span class="token string">'Welcome To TutorialsPoint'</span></div>
<p>A string in Python is an object of <strong>str</strong> class. It can be verified with <strong>type()</strong> function.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Welcome To TutorialsPoint"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'str'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>You want to embed some text in double quotes as a part of string, the string itself should be put in single quotes. To embed a single quoted text, string should be written in double quotes.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token string">'Welcome to "Python Tutorial" from TutorialsPoint'</span> <span class="token string">'Welcome to "Python Tutorial" from TutorialsPoint'</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token string">"Welcome to 'Python Tutorial' from TutorialsPoint"</span> <span class="token string">"Welcome to 'Python Tutorial' from TutorialsPoint"</span></div>
<p>Since a string is a sequence, each character in it is having a positional index starting from 0. To form a string with triple quotes, you may use triple single quotes, or triple double quotes &minus; both versions are similar.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token triple-quoted-string string">'''Welcome To TutorialsPoint'''</span> <span class="token string">'Welcome To TutorialsPoint'</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token triple-quoted-string string">"""Welcome To TutorialsPoint"""</span> <span class="token string">'Welcome To TutorialsPoint'</span></div>
<p>Triple quoted string is useful to form a multi-line string.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token triple-quoted-string string">''' ... Welcome To ... Python Tutorial ... from TutorialsPoint ... '''</span> <span class="token string">'\nWelcome To\nPython Tutorial \nfrom TutorialsPoint\n'</span></div>
<p>A string is a non-numeric data type. Obviously, we cannot perform arithmetic operations on it. However, operations such as <strong>slicing</strong> and <strong>concatenation</strong> can be done. Python's str class defines a number of useful methods for string processing. We shall learn these methods in the subsequent chapter on Strings.</p>
<h2>List in Python</h2>
<p>In Python, List is an ordered collection of any type of data items. Data items are separated by comma (,) symbol and enclosed in square brackets (<strong>[]</strong>). A list is also a sequence, hence.</p>
<p>each item in the list has an index referring to its position in the collection. The index starts from 0.</p>
<p>The list in Python appears to be similar to array in C or C++. However, there is an important difference between the two. In C/C++, array is a homogenous collection of data of similar types. Items in the Python list may be of different types.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">2023</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Python"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">5</span><span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token number">6j</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1.23E-4</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span></div>
<p>A list in Python is an object of <strong>list</strong> class. We can check it with type() function.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">2023</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Python"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">5</span><span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token number">6j</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1.23E-4</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'list'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>As mentioned, an item in the list may be of any data type. It means that a list object can also be an item in another list. In that case, it becomes a nested list.</p>

<p>A list item may be a tuple, dictionary, set or object of user defined class also.</p>
<p>List being a sequence, it supports slicing and concatenation operations as in case of string. With the methods/functions available in Python's built-in list class, we can add, delete or update items, and sort or rearrange the items in the desired order. We shall study these aspects in a subsequent chapter.</p>
<h2>Tuples in Python</h2>
<p>In Python, a Tuple is an ordered collection of any type of data items. Data items are separated by comma (,) symbol and enclosed in parentheses or round brackets <strong>()</strong>. A tuple is also a sequence, hence each item in the tuple has an index referring to its position in the collection. The index starts from 0.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">2023</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Python"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">5</span><span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token number">6j</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1.23E-4</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>In Python, a tuple is an object of <strong>tuple</strong> class. We can check it with the type() function.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">2023</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Python"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">5</span><span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token number">6j</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1.23E-4</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'tuple'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>As in case of a list, an item in the tuple may also be a list, a tuple itself or an object of any other Python class.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'One'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'Two'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'Three'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">2.0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">1.0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2.0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3.0</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>To form a tuple, use of parentheses is optional. Data items separated by comma without any enclosing symbols are treated as a tuple by default.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token number">2023</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Python"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">5</span><span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token number">6j</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1.23E-4</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">2023</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'Python'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">5</span><span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token number">6j</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">0.000123</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>The two sequence types list and tuple appear to be similar except the use of delimiters, list uses square brackets ([]) while tuple uses parentheses. However, there is one major</p>
<h3>&nbsp;</h3>
<p>difference between list and tuple. List is mutable object, whereas tuple is <strong>immutable</strong>. An object is immutable means once it is stored in the memory, it cannot be changed.</p>
<p>Let us try to understand the mutability concept. We have a list and tuple object with same data items.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> l1<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> t1<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>Both are sequences, hence each item in both has an index. Item at index number 1 in both is 2.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> l1<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token number">2</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> t1<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token number">2</span></div>
<p>Let us try to change the value of item index number 1 from 2 to 20 in list as well as tuple.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> l1<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token number">2</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> t1<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token number">2</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> l1<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">20</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> l1 <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> t1<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">20</span> Traceback <span class="token punctuation">(</span>most recent call last<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> File <span class="token string">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> line <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">in</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>module<span class="token operator">&gt;</span> TypeError<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'tuple'</span> <span class="token builtin">object</span> does <span class="token keyword">not</span> support item assignment</div>
<p>The error message <strong>'tuple' object does not support item assignment</strong> tells you that a tuple object cannot be modified once it is formed. This is called an immutable object.</p>
<p>Immutability of tuple also means that Python's tuple class doesn't have the functionality to add, delete or sort items in a tuple. However, since it is a sequence, we can perform slicing and concatenation.</p>
<h2>Dictionary Type</h2>
<p>Python's dictionary is example of <strong>mapping</strong> type. A mapping object 'maps' value of one object with another. In a language dictionary we have pairs of word and corresponding meaning. Two parts of pair are key (word) and value (meaning). Similarly, Python dictionary is also a collection of <strong>key:value</strong> pairs. The pairs are separated by comma and put inside curly brackets {}. To establish mapping between key and value, the semicolon':' symbol is put between the two.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token string">'one'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token string">'two'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token string">'three'</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></div>
<p>Each key in a dictionary must be unique, and should be a number, string or tuple. The value object may be of any type, and may be mapped with more than one keys (they need not be unique)</p>
<p>In Python, dictionary is an object of the built-in <strong>dict</strong> class. We can check it with the type() function.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token string">'one'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token string">'two'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token string">'three'</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'dict'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>Python's dictionary is not a sequence. It is a collection of items but each item (key:value pair) is not identified by positional index as in string, list or tuple. Hence, slicing operation cannot be done on a dictionary. Dictionary is a mutable object, so it is possible to perform add, modify or delete actions with corresponding functionality defined in dict class. These operations will be explained in a subsequent chapter.</p>
<h2>Set Type</h2>
<p>Set is a Python implementation of set as defined in Mathematics. A set in Python is a collection, but is not an indexed or ordered collection as string, list or tuple. An object cannot appear more than once in a set, whereas in List and Tuple, same object can appear more than once.</p>
<p>Comma separated items in a set are put inside curly brackets or braces. Items in the set collection may be of different data types.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token number">2023</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Python"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">5</span><span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token number">6j</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1.23E-4</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">5</span><span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token number">6j</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">0.000123</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'Python'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2023</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span></div>
<p>Note that items in the set collection may not follow the same order in which they are entered. The position of items is optimized by Python to perform operations over set as defined in mathematics.</p>
<p>Python's Set is an object of built-in <strong>set</strong> class, as can be checked with the type() function.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token number">2023</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"Python"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3.11</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">5</span><span class="token operator">+</span><span class="token number">6j</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1.23E-4</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'set'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>A set can store only immutable objects such as number (int, float, complex or bool), string or tuple. If you try to put a list or a dictionary in the set collection, Python raises a <strong>TypeError</strong>.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token punctuation">{</span><span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'One'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'Two'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'Three'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">1.0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2.0</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">3.0</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">}</span> Traceback <span class="token punctuation">(</span>most recent call last<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> File <span class="token string">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> line <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">in</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>module<span class="token operator">&gt;</span> TypeError<span class="token punctuation">:</span> unhashable <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'list'</span></div>
<p><strong>Hashing</strong> is a mechanism in computer science which enables quicker searching of objects in computer's memory. <strong>Only immutable objects are hashable</strong>.</p>
<p>Even if a set doesn't allow mutable items, the set itself is mutable. Hence, add/delete/update operations are permitted on a set object, using the methods in built-in set class. Python also has a set of operators to perform set manipulation. The methods and operators are explained in a latter chapter</p>
<h1>Python - Type Casting</h1>
<p>In manufacturing, casting is the process of pouring a liquefied or molten metal into a mold, and letting it cool to obtain the desired shape. In programming, casting refers to converting an object of one type into another. Here, we shall learn about type casting in Python.</p>
<p>In Python there are different data types, such as numbers, sequences, mappings etc. There may be a situation where, you have the available data of one type but you want to use it in another form. For example, the user has input a string but you want to use it as a number. Python's type casting mechanism let you do that.</p>
<h2>Implicit Casting in Python</h2>
<p>Casting is of two types &minus; <strong>implicit</strong> and <strong>explicit</strong>.</p>
<p>When any language compiler/interpreter automatically converts object of one type into other, it is called implicit casting. Python is a strongly typed language. It doesn't allow automatic type conversion between unrelated data types. For example, a string cannot be converted to any number type. However, an integer can be cast into a float. Other languages such as JavaScript is a weakly typed language, where an integer is coerced into a string for concatenation.</p>
<p>Note that memory requirement of each type is different. For example, an integer object in Python occupies 4 bytes of memory, while a float object needs 8 bytes because of its fractional part. Hence, Python interpreter doesn't automatically convert a float to int, because it will result in loss of data. On the other hand, int can be easily converted into float by setting its fractional part to 0.</p>
<p>Implicit int to float casting takes place when any arithmetic operation one int and float operands is done.</p>
<p>We have an integer and one float variable</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token comment"># int object</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> b<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">10.5</span> <span class="token comment"># float object</span></div>
<p>To perform their addition, 10 &minus; the integer object is upgraded to 10.0. It is a float, but equivalent to its earlier numeric value. Now we can perform addition of two floats.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> c<span class="token operator">=</span>a<span class="token operator">+</span>b <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>c<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token number">20.5</span></div>
<p>In implicit type casting, the object with lesser byte size is upgraded to match the byte size of other object in the operation. For example, a Boolean object is first upgraded to int and then to float, before the addition with a floating point object. In the following example, we try to add a Boolean object in a float.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token boolean">True</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> b<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">10.5</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> c<span class="token operator">=</span>a<span class="token operator">+</span>b <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>c<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token number">11.5</span></div>
<p>Note that True is equal to 1, and False is equal to 0.</p>
<p>Although automatic or implicit casting is limited to <strong>int</strong> to <strong>float</strong> conversion, you can use Python's built-in functions to perform the explicit conversions such as string to integer.</p>
<h2>int() Function</h2>
<p>Python's built-in int() function converts an integer literal to an integer object, a float to integer, and a string to integer if the string itself has a valid integer literal representation.</p>
<p>Using int() with an int object as argument is equivalent to declaring an <strong>int</strong> object directly.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token number">10</span></div>
<p>is same as &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> '<span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>If the argument to int() function is a float object or floating point expression, it returns an int object. For example &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10.5</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token comment">#converts a float object to int</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">2</span><span class="token operator">*</span><span class="token number">3.14</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token comment">#expression results float, is converted to int</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token number">6</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'int'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>The int() function also returns integer 1 if a Boolean object is given as argument.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token boolean">True</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'int'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<h3>String to Integer</h3>
<p>The int() function returns an integer from a string object, only if it contains a valid integer representation.</p>

<p>The int() function also returns integer from binary, octal and hexa-decimal string. For this, the function needs a base parameter which must be 2, 8 or 16 respectively. The string should have a valid binary/octal/Hexa-decimal representation.</p>
<h3>Binary String to Integer</h3>
<p>The string should be made up of 1 and 0 only, and the base should be 2.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"110011"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token number">51</span></div>
<p>The Decimal equivalent of binary number 110011 is 51.</p>
<h3>Octal String to Integer</h3>
<p>The string should only contain 0 to 7 digits, and the base should be 8.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"20"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">8</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token number">16</span></div>
<p>The Decimal equivalent of octal 20 is 16.</p>
<h3>Hexa-Decimal String to Integer</h3>
<p>The string should contain only the Hexadecimal symbols i.e., 0-9 and A, B, C, D, E or F. Base should be 16.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"2A9"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">16</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token number">681</span></div>
<p>Decimal equivalent of Hexadecimal 2A9 is 681.</p>
<p>You can easily verify these conversions with calculator app in Windows, Ubuntu or Smartphones.</p>
<h2>float() Function</h2>
<p>float() is a built-in function in Python. It returns a float object if the argument is a float literal, integer or a string with valid floating point representation.</p>
<p>Using float() with an float object as argument is equivalent to declaring a float object directly</p>

<p>If the argument to float() function is an integer, the returned value is a floating point with fractional part set to 0.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">float</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">100</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token number">100.0</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'float'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>The float() function returns float object from a string, if the string contains a valid floating point number, otherwise ValueError is raised.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">float</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"9.99"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token number">9.99</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'float'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">float</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"1,234.50"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> Traceback <span class="token punctuation">(</span>most recent call last<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> File <span class="token string">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> line <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">in</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>module<span class="token operator">&gt;</span> ValueError<span class="token punctuation">:</span> could <span class="token keyword">not</span> convert string to <span class="token builtin">float</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'1,234.50'</span></div>
<p>The reason of ValueError here is the presence of comma in the string.</p>
<p>For the purpose of string to float conversion, the sceientific notation of floating point is also considered valid.</p>

<h2>str() Function</h2>
<p>We saw how a Python obtains integer or float number from corresponding string representation. The str() function works the opposite. It surrounds an integer or a float object with quotes (') to return a str object. The str() function returns the string.</p>
<p>representation of any Python object. In this section, we shall see different examples of str() function in Python.</p>
<p>The str() function has three parameters. First required parameter (or argument) is the object whose string representation we want. Other two operators, encoding and errors, are optional.</p>
<p>We shall execute str() function in Python console to easily verify that the returned object is a string, with the enclosing quotation marks (').</p>
<p>Integer to string</p>

<h3>Float to String</h3>
<p>str() function converts floating point objects with both the notations of floating point, standard notation with a decimal point separating integer and fractional part, and the scientific notation to string object.</p>

<p>In the second case, a division expression is given as argument to str() function. Note that the expression is evaluated first and then result is converted to string.</p>
<p>Floating points in scientific notations using E or e and with positive or negative power are converted to string with str() function.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token builtin">str</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10E4</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token string">'100000.0'</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'str'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token builtin">str</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">1.23e-4</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token string">'0.000123'</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'str'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>When Boolean constant is entered as argument, it is surrounded by (') so that True becomes 'True'. List and Tuple objects can also be given argument to str() function. The resultant string is the list/tuple surrounded by (').</p>

<h2>Conversion of Sequence Types</h2>
<p>List, Tuple and String are Python's sequence types. They are ordered or indexed collection of items.</p>
<p>A string and tuple can be converted into a list object by using the <strong>list()</strong> function. Similarly, the <strong>tuple()</strong> function converts a string or list to a tuple.</p>
<p>We shall an object each of these three sequence types and study their inter-conversion.</p>

<p>Thus Python's explicit type casting feature allows conversion of one data type to other with the help of its built-in functions.</p>
<h1>Python - Unicode System</h1>
<p>Software applications often require to display messages output in a variety in different languages such as in English, French, Japanese, Hebrew, or Hindi. Python's string type uses the Unicode Standard for representing characters. It makes the program possible to work with all these different possible characters.</p>
<p>A character is the smallest possible component of a text. 'A', 'B', 'C', etc., are all different characters. So are '' and ''.</p>
<p>According to The Unicode standard, characters are represented by code points. A code point value is an integer in the range 0 to 0x10FFFF.</p>
<p>A sequence of code points is represented in memory as a set of code units, mapped to 8-bit bytes. The rules for translating a Unicode string into a sequence of bytes are called a character encoding.</p>
<p>Three types of encodings are present, UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32. UTF stands for <strong>Unicode Transformation Format</strong>.</p>
<p>Python 3.0 onwards has built-in support for Unicode. The <strong>str</strong> type contains Unicode characters, hence any string created using single, double or the triple-quoted string syntax is stored as Unicode. The default encoding for Python source code is UTF-8.</p>
<p>Hence, string may contain literal representation of a Unicode character (3/4) or its Unicode value (\u00BE).</p>

<p>Strings display the text in a human-readable format, and bytes store the characters as binary data. Encoding converts data from a character string to a series of bytes. Decoding translates the bytes back to human-readable characters and symbols. It is important not</p>
<p>to confuse these two methods. encode is a string method, while decode is a method of the Python byte object.</p>
<p>In the following example, we have a string variable that consists of ASCII characters. ASCII is a subset of Unicode character set. The encode() method is used to convert it into a bytes object.</p>

<h1>Python - Literals</h1>
<p>In computer science, a literal is a notation for representing a fixed value in source code. For example, in the assignment statement.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">10</span></div>
<p>Here 10 is a literal as numeric value representing 10 is directly stored in memory. However,</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">y <span class="token operator">=</span> x<span class="token operator">*</span><span class="token number">2</span></div>
<p>Here, even if the expression evaluates to 20, it is not literally included in source code. You can also declare an int object with built-in int() function &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>However, this is also an indirect way of instantiation and not with literal.</p>
<p>You can create use literal representation for creating object of any built-in data type.</p>
<h2>Integer Literal</h2>
<p>Any representation involving only the digit symbols (0 to 9) creates an object of <strong>int</strong> type. The object so declared may be referred by a variable using an assignment operator.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following <strong>example</strong> &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">10</span> y <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">25</span> z <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0</span></div>
<p>Python allows an integer to be represented as an octal number or a hexadecimal number. A numeric representation with only eight digit symbols (0 to 7) but prefixed by 0o or 0O is an octal number.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0O34</span></div>
<p>Similarly, a series of hexadecimal symbols (0 to 9 and a to f), prefixed by 0x or 0X represents an integer in Hexedecimal form.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0X1C</span></div>
<p>However, it may be noted that, even if you use octal or hexadecimal literal notation, Python internally treats it as of <strong>int</strong> type.</p>

</pre>
<h2>Float Literal</h2>
<p>A floating point number consists of an integral part and a fractional part. Conventionally, a decimal point symbol (.) separates these two parts in a literal representation of a float. For example,</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">x <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">25.55</span> y <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0.05</span> z <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">12.2345</span></div>
<p>For a floating point number which is too large or too small, where number of digits before or after decimal point is more, a scientific notation is used for a compact literal representation. The symbol E or e followed by positive or negative integer, follows after the integer part.</p>
<p>For example, a number 1.23E05 is equivalent to 123000.00. Similarly, 1.23e-2 is equivalent to 0.0123</p>

</div>
<p>Here, you will get the following <strong>output</strong> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">1.23 in normal float literal is 1.23 &lt;class 'float'&gt;
1.23E5 in scientific notation is 123000.0 &lt;class 'float''&gt;
1.23E-2 in scientific notation is 0.0123 &lt;class 'float''&gt;

<h2>Complex Literal</h2>
<p>A complex number comprises of a real and imaginary component. The imaginary component is any number (integer or floating point) multiplied by square root of "-1"</p>

<h2>String Literal</h2>
<p>A string object is one of the sequence data types in Python. It is an immutable sequence of Unicode code points. Code point is a number corresponding to a character according to Unicode standard. Strings are objects of Python's built-in class 'str'.</p>
<p>String literals are written by enclosing a sequence of characters in single quotes ('hello'), double quotes ("hello") or triple quotes ('''hello''' or """hello""").</p>

<h1>Python - Operators</h1>
<p>In Python as well as any programming language, Operators are symbols (sometimes keywords) that are predefined to perform a certain most commonly required operations on one or more operands.</p>
<h2>Types of Operators</h2>
<p>Python language supports the following types of operators &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>Arithmetic Operators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Comparison (Relational) Operators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Assignment Operators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Logical Operators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Bitwise Operators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Membership Operators</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Identity Operators</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Let us have a look at all the operators one by one.</p>
<h1>Python - Arithmetic Operators</h1>
<p>In Python, numbers are the most frequently used data type. Python uses the same symbols for basic arithmetic operations Everybody is familiar with, i.e., "+" for addition, "-" for subtraction, "*" for multiplication (most programming languages use "*" instead of the "x" as used in maths/algebra), and "/" for division (again for the "" used in Mathematics).</p>
<p>In addition, Python defines few more arithmetic operators. They are "%" (Modulus), "**" (Exponent) and "//" (Floor division).</p>
<p>Arithmetic operators are binary operators in the sense they operate on two operands. Python fully supports mixed arithmetic. That is, the two operands can be of two different number types. In such a situation, Python widens the narrower of the operands. An integer object is narrower than float object, and float is narrower than complex object. Hence, the result of arithmetic operation of int and a float is a float. Result of float and a complex is a complex number, similarly, operation on an integer and a complex object results in a complex object.</p>
<p>Let us study these operators with examples.</p>
<h2>Python &minus; Addition Operator (+)</h2>
<p>This operator pronounced as plus, is a basic arithmetic operator. It adds the two numeric operands on the either side and returns the addition result.</p>
<p>In the following example, the two integer variables are the operands for the "+" operator.</p>

<h2>Python &minus; Multiplication Operator (*)</h2>
<p>The * (asterisk) symbol is defined as a multiplication operator in Python (as in many languages). It returns the product of the two operands on its either side. If any of the operands negative, the result is also negative. If both are negative, the result is positive. Changing the order of operands doesn't change the result</p>

<h2>Python &minus; Division Operator (/)</h2>
<p>The "/" symbol is usually called as forward slash. The result of division operator is numerator (left operand) divided by denominator (right operand). The resultant number is negative if any of the operands is negative. Since infinity cannot be stored in the memory, Python raises ZeroDivisionError if the denominator is 0.</p>
<p>The result of division operator in Python is always a float, even if both operands are integers.</p>

<h2>Python &minus; Modulus Operator (%)</h2>
<p>Python defines the "%" symbol, which is known aa Percent symbol, as Modulus (or modulo) operator. It returns the remainder after the denominator divides the numerator. It can also be called Remainder operator. The result of the modulus operator is the number that remains after the integer quotient. To give an example, when 10 is divided by 3, the quotient is 3 and remainder is 1. Hence, 10%3 (normally pronounced as 10 mod 3) results in 1.</p>
<p>If both the operands are integer, the modulus value is an integer. If numerator is completely divisible, remainder is 0. If numerator is smaller than denominator, modulus is equal to the numerator. If denominator is 0, Python raises ZeroDivisionError.</p>

<p>Python doesn't accept complex numbers to be used as operand in modulus operation. It throws TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for %.</p>
<h2>Python &minus; Exponent Operator (**)</h2>
<p>Python uses ** (double asterisk) as the exponent operator (sometimes called raised to operator). So, for a**b, you say a raised to b, or even bth power of a.</p>
<p>If in the exponentiation expression, both operands are integer, result is also an integer. In case either one is a float, the result is float. Similarly, if either one operand is complex number, exponent operator returns a complex number.</p>
<p>If the base is 0, the result is 0, and if the index is 0 then the result is always 1.</p>

<h2>Python &minus; Floor Division Operator (//)</h2>
<p>Floor division is also called as integer division. Python uses // (double forward slash) symbol for the purpose. Unlike the modulus or modulo which returns the remainder, the floor division gives the quotient of the division of operands involved.</p>
<p>If both operands are positive, floor operator returns a number with fractional part removed from it. For example, the floor division of 9.8 by 2 returns 4 (pure division is 4.9, strip the fractional part, result is 4).</p>
<p>But if one of the operands is negative, the result is rounded away from zero (towards negative infinity). Floor division of -9.8 by 2 returns 5 (pure division is -4.9, rounded away from 0).</p>

<h1>Python - Assignment Operators</h1>
<p>The = (equal to) symbol is defined as assignment operator in Python. The value of Python expression on its right is assigned to a single variable on its left. The = symbol as in programming in general (and Python in particular) should not be confused with its usage in Mathematics, where it states that the expressions on the either side of the symbol are equal.</p>
<p>In addition to the simple assignment operator, Python provides few more assignment operators for advanced use. They are called cumulative or augmented assignment operators. In this chapter, we shall learn to use augmented assignment operators defined in Python.</p>
<p>Consider following Python statements &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">a<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">10</span> b<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">5</span> a<span class="token operator">=</span>a<span class="token operator">+</span>b <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>At the first instance, at least for somebody new to programming but who knows maths, the statement "a=a+b" looks strange. How could a be equal to "a+b"? However, it needs to be reemphasized that the = symbol is an assignment operator here and not used to show the equality of LHS and RHS.</p>
<p>Because it is an assignment, the expression on right evaluates to 15, the value is assigned to a.</p>
<p>In the statement "a+=b", the two operators "+" and "=" can be combined in a "+=" operator. It is called as add and assign operator. In a single statement, it performs addition of two operands "a" and "b", and result is assigned to operand on left, i.e., "a".</p>
<p>The += operator is an augmented operator. It is also called cumulative addition operator, as it adds "b" in "a" and assigns the result back to a variable.</p>
<p>Python has the augmented assignment operators for all arithmetic and comparison operators.</p>
<h1>Python - Augmented Addition Operator (+=)</h1>
<p>This operator combines addition and assignment in one statement. Since Python supports mixed arithmetic, the two operands may be of different types. However, the type of left operand changes to the operand of on right, if it is wider.</p>
<p>Following examples will help in understanding how the "+=" operator works &minus;</p>

<h1>Python - Comparison Operators</h1>
<p>Comparison operators in Python are very important in Python's conditional statements (<strong>if, else</strong> and <strong>elif</strong>) and looping statements (while and for loops). Like arithmetic operators, the comparison operators "-" also called relational operators, ("&lt;" stands for less than, and"&gt;" stands for greater than) are well known.</p>
<p>Python uses two more operators, combining "=" symbol with these two. The "&lt;=" symbol is for less than or equal to. The "&gt;=" symbol is for greater than or equal to.</p>
<p>Python has two more comparison operators in the form of "==" and "!=". They are for is equal to and is not equal to operators. Hence, there are six comparison operators in Python.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>&lt;</td>
<td>Less than</td>
<td>a&lt;b</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;</td>
<td>Greater than</td>
<td>a&gt;b</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&lt;=</td>
<td>Less than or equal to</td>
<td>a&lt;=b</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&gt;=</td>
<td>Greater than or equal to</td>
<td>a&gt;=b</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>==</td>
<td>Is equal to</td>
<td>a==b</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>!=</td>
<td>Is not equal to</td>
<td>a!=b</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Comparison operators are binary in nature, requiring two operands. An expression involving a comparison operator is called a Boolean expression, and always returns either True or False.</p>

<p>Sequence objects are compared by lexicographical ordering mechanism. The comparison starts from item at 0th index. If they are equal, comparison moves to next index till the items at certain index happen to be not equal, or one of the sequences is exhausted. If one sequence is an initial sub-sequence of the other, the shorter sequence is the smaller (lesser) one.</p>
<p>Which of the operands is greater depends on the difference in values of items at the index where they are unequal. For example, 'BAT'&gt;'BAR' is True, as T comes after R in Unicode order.</p>
<p>If all items of two sequences compare equal, the sequences are considered equal.</p>

<h3>Comparison of Dictionary Objects</h3>
<p>The use of "&lt;" and "&gt;" operators for Python's dictionary is not defined. In case of these operands, TypeError: '&lt;' not supported between instances of 'dict' and 'dict' is reported.</p>
<p>Equality comparison checks if the length of both the dict items is same. Length of dictionary is the number of key-value pairs in it.</p>
<p>Python dictionaries are simply compared by length. The dictionary with fewer elements is considered less than a dictionary with more elements.</p>

<h1>Python - Logical Operators</h1>
<p>With Logical operators in Python, we can form compound Boolean expressions. Each operand for these logical operators is itself a Boolean expression. For example,</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">age<span class="token operator">&gt;</span><span class="token number">16</span> <span class="token keyword">and</span> marks<span class="token operator">&gt;</span><span class="token number">80</span> percentage<span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token number">50</span> <span class="token keyword">or</span> attendance<span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token number">75</span></div>
<p>Along with the keyword False, Python interprets None, numeric zero of all types, and empty sequences (strings, tuples, lists), empty dictionaries, and empty sets as False. All other values are treated as True.</p>
<p>There are three logical operators in Python. They are "and", "or" and "not". They must be in lowercase.</p>
<h3>The "and" Operator</h3>
<p>For the compound Boolean expression to be True, both the operands must be True. If any or both operands evaluate to False, the expression returns False. The following table shows the scenarios.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered" style="text-align: center;">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">a</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">b</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">a and b</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>F</td>
<td>F</td>
<td>F</td>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>T</td>
<td>F</td>
<td>F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>T</td>
<td>T</td>
<td>T</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>The "or" Operator</h3>
<p>In contrast, the or operator returns True if any of the operands is True. For the compound Boolean expression to be False, both the operands have to be False, ss the following table shows &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">a</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">b</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">a or b</th>
</tr>
<tr>

</tr>
<tr>
<td>T</td>
<td>F</td>
<td>F</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>T</td>
<td>T</td>
<td>T</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>The "not" Operator</h3>
<p>This is a unary operator. The state of Boolean operand that follows, is reversed. As a result, not True becomes False and not False becomes True.</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">
<tbody>
<tr>
<th style="text-align: center;">a</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">not (a)</th>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>F</td>
<td>T</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>T</td>
<td>F</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3>How the Python interpreter evaluates the logical operators?</h3>
<p>The expression "x and y" first evaluates "x". If "x" is false, its value is returned; otherwise, "y" is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.</p>
<img src="/python/images/logical_operator.jpg" alt="logical_operator" />
<p>The expression "x or y" first evaluates "x"; if "x" is true, its value is returned; otherwise, "y" is evaluated and the resulting value is returned.</p>
<img src="/python/images/x_or_y.jpg" alt="x_or_y" />

x &gt; 10 or y &gt; 10: True
x%2 == 0 and y%2 == 0: True
not (x+y&gt;15): False
</pre>
<p>We can use non-boolean operands with logical operators. Here, we need to not that any non-zero numbers, and non-empty sequences evaluate to True. Hence, the same truth tables of logical operators apply.</p>
<p>In the following example, numeric operands are used for logical operators. The variables "x", "y" evaluate to True, "z" is False</p>

<h1>Python - Bitwise Operators</h1>
<p>Python' bitwise operators are normally used with integer type objects. However, instead of treating the object as a whole, it is treated as a string of bits. Different operations are done on each bit in the string.</p>
<p>Python has six bitwise operators - &amp;, |, ^, ~, &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;. All these operators (except ~) are binary in nature, in the sense they operate on two operands. Each operand is a binary digit (bit) 1 or 0.</p>
<h2>Python &minus; Bitwise AND Operator (&amp;)</h2>
<p>Bitwise AND operator is somewhat similar to logical and operator. It returns True only if both the bit operands are 1 (i.e. True). All the combinations are &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token number">0</span> <span class="token operator">&amp;</span> <span class="token number">0</span> <span class="token keyword">is</span> <span class="token number">0</span> <span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token operator">&amp;</span> <span class="token number">0</span> <span class="token keyword">is</span> <span class="token number">0</span> <span class="token number">0</span> <span class="token operator">&amp;</span> <span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token keyword">is</span> <span class="token number">0</span> <span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token operator">&amp;</span> <span class="token number">1</span> <span class="token keyword">is</span> <span class="token number">1</span></div>
<p>When you use integers as the operands, both are converted in equivalent binary, the &amp; operation is done on corresponding bit from each number, starting from the least significant bit and going towards most significant bit.</p>
<p>Let us take two integers 60 and 13, and assign them to variables a and b respectively.</p>

<h2>Python &minus; Binary NOT Operator (~)</h2>
<p>This operator is the binary equivalent of logical NOT operator. It flips each bit so that 1 is replaced by 0, and 0 by 1, and returns the complement of the original number. Python uses 2's complement method. For positive integers, it is obtained simply by reversing the bits. For negative number, -x, it is written using the bit pattern for (x-1) with all of the bits complemented (switched from 1 to 0 or 0 to 1). Hence: (for 8 bit representation)</p>

<h1>Python - Membership Operators</h1>
<p>The membership operators in Python help us determine whether an item is present in a given container type object, or in other words, whether an item is a member of the given container type object.</p>
<p>Python has two membership operators: "in" and "not in". Both return a Boolean result. The result of "in" operator is opposite to that of "not in" operator.</p>
<p>You can use in operator to check whether a substring is present in a bigger string, any item is present in a list or tuple, or a sub-list or sub-tuple is included in a list or tuple.</p>
<p>In the following example, different substrings are checked whether they belong to the string var="TutorialsPoint". Python differentiates characters on the basis of their Unicode value. Hence "To" is not the same as "to". Also note that if the "in" operator returns True, the "not in" operator evaluates to False.</p>

<h1>Python - Identity Operators</h1>
<p>Python has two identity operators is and is not. Both return opposite Boolean values. The "in" operator evaluates to True if both the operand objects share the same memory location. The memory location of the object can be obtained by the "id()" function. If the id() of both variables is same, the "in" operator returns True (as a consequence, is not returns False).</p>

<h1>Python - Comments</h1>
<p>A comment in a computer program is a piece of text that is meant to be an explanatory or descriptive annotation in the source code and is not to be considered by compiler/interpreter while generating machine language code. Ample use of comments in source program makes it easier for everybody concerned to understand more about syntax, usage and logic of the algorithm etc.</p>
<p>In a Python script, the symbol # marks the beginning of comment line. It is effective till the end of line in the editor. If # is the first character of line, then entire line is a comment. If used in the middle of a line, text before it is a valid Python expression, while text following it is treated as comment.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token comment"># this is a comment</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hello World"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"How are you?"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token comment">#also a comment but after a statement.</span></div>
<p>In Python, there is no provision to write multi-line comment, or a block comment. (As in C/C++, where multiple lines inside /* .. */ are treated as multi-line comment).</p>
<p>Each line should have the "#" symbol at the start to be marked as comment. Many Python IDEs have shortcuts to mark a block of statements as comment.</p>
<p>A triple quoted multi-line string is also treated as comment if it is not a docstring of a function or class.</p>

<h1>Python - User Input</h1>
<p>Every computer application should have a provision to accept data from the user when it is running. This makes the application interactive. Depending on how it is developed, an application may accept the user input in the form of text entered in the console <strong>(sys.stdin)</strong>, a graphical layout, or a web-based interface. In this chapter, we shall learn how Python accepts the user input from the console, and displays the output also on the console.</p>
<p>Python interpreter works in interactive and scripted mode. While the interactive mode is good for quick evaluations, it is less productive. For repeated execution of same set of instructions, scripted mode should be used.</p>
<p>Let us write a simple Python script to start with.</p>

<p>The program simply prints the values of the two variables in it. If you run the program repeatedly, the same output will be displayed every time. To use the program for another name and city, you can edit the code, change name to say "Ravi" and city to "Chennai". Every time you need to assign different value, you will have to edit the program, save and run, which is not the ideal way.</p>
<h2>input() Function</h2>
<p>Obviously, you need some mechanism to assign different value to the variable in the runtime &minus; while the program is running. Python's <strong>input()</strong> function does the same job.</p>
<p>Python's standard library has the input() function.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> var <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">input</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>When the interpreter encounters it, it waits for the user to enter data from the standard input stream (keyboard) till the Enter key is pressed. The sequence of characters may be stored in a string variable for further use.</p>
<p>On reading the Enter key, the program proceeds to the next statement. Let use change our program to store the user input in name and city variables.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token comment">#! /usr/bin/python3.11</span> name <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">input</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> city <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">input</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hello My name is"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> name<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"I am from "</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> city<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>When you run, you will find the cursor waiting for user's input. Enter values for name and city. Using the entered data, the output will be displayed.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">Ravi
Chennai
Hello My name is Ravi
I am from Chennai
</pre>
<p>Now, the variables are not assigned any specific value in the program. Every time you run, different values can be input. So, your program has become truly interactive.</p>
<p>Inside the input() function, you may give a <strong>prompt</strong> text, which will appear before the cursor when you run the code.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token comment">#! /usr/bin/python3.11</span> name <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">input</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Enter your name : "</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> city <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">input</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"enter your city : "</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hello My name is"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> name<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"I am from "</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> city<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>When you run the program displays the prompt message, basically helping the user what to enter.</p>

</pre>
<p>Why do you get a <strong>TypeError</strong> here? The reason is, Python always read the user input as a string. Hence, width="20" and height="30" are the strings and obviously you cannot perform multiplication of two strings.</p>
<p>To overcome this problem, we shall use <strong>int()</strong>, another built-in function from Python's standard library. It converts a string object to an integer.</p>

<h3>print() Function</h3>
<p>Python's print() function is a built-in function. It is the most frequently used function, that displays value of Python expression given in parenthesis, on Python's console, or standard output <strong>(sys.stdout)</strong>.</p>

<h1>Python - Numbers</h1>
<p>Most of the times you work with numbers in whatever you do. Obviously, any computer application deals with numbers. Hence, programming languages, Python included, have built-in support to store and process numeric data.</p>
<p>In this chapter, we shall learn about properties of Python number types in detail.</p>
<p>Three number types, integers <strong>(int)</strong>, floating point numbers <strong>(float)</strong> and <strong>complex</strong> numbers, are built into the Python interpreter. Python also has a bult-in Boolean data type called <strong>bool</strong>. It can be treated as a sub-type of int type, since its two possible values True and False represent the integers 1 and 0 respectively.</p>
<h2>Python &minus; Integers</h2>
<p>In Python, any number without the provision to store a fractional part is an integer. (Note that if the fractional part in a number is 0, it doesn't mean that it is an integer. For example a number 10.0 is not an integer, it is a float with 0 fractional part whose numeric value is 10.) An integer can be zero, positive or a negative whole number. For example, 1234, 0, -55.</p>
<p>There are three ways to form an integer object. With literal representation, any expression evaluating to an integer, and using <strong>int()</strong> function.</p>
<p>Literal is a notation used to represent a constant directly in the source code. For example &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a <span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">10</span></div>
<p>However, look at the following assignment of the integer variable c.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">a<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">10</span> b<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">20</span> c<span class="token operator">=</span>a<span class="token operator">+</span>b <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"a:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> a<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">"type:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>It will produce the following <strong>output</strong> &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">a<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span><span class="token keyword">class</span> <span class="token string">'int'</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span></div>
<p>Here, c is indeed an integer variable, but the expression a+b is evaluated first, and its value is indirectly assigned to c.</p>
<p>The third method of forming an integer object is with the return value of int() function. It converts a floating point number or a string in an integer.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10.5</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> b<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"100"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>You can represent an integer as a binary, octal or Hexa-decimal number. However, internally the object is stored as an integer.</p>
<h3>Binary Numbers</h3>
<p>A number consisting of only the binary digits (1 and 0) and prefixed with <strong>0b</strong> is a binary number. If you assign a binary number to a variable, it still is an int variable.</p>
<p>A represent an integer in binary form, store it directly as a literal, or use int() function, in which the base is set to 2</p>

<h3>Octal Numbers</h3>
<p>An octal number is made up of digits 0 to 7 only. In order to specify that the integer uses octal notation, it needs to be prefixed by <strong>0o</strong> (lowercase O) or <strong>0O</strong> (uppercase O). A literal representation of octal number is as follows &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">a<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">0O107</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token builtin">type</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>It will produce the following <strong>output</strong> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">71 &lt;class 'int'&gt;
</pre>
<p>Note that the object is internally stored as integer. Decimal equivalent of octal number 107 is 71.</p>
<p>Since octal number system has 8 symbols (0 to 7), its base is 7. Hence, while using int() function to covert an octal string to integer, you need to set the base argument to 8.</p>

<h3>Hexa-decimal Numbers</h3>
<p>As the name suggests, there are 16 symbols in the Hexadecimal number system. They are 0-9 and A to F. The first 10 digits are same as decimal digits. The alphabets A, B, C, D, E and F are equivalents of 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, and 16 respectively. Upper or lower cases may be used for these letter symbols.</p>
<p>For the literal representation of an integer in Hexadecimal notation, prefix it by <strong>0x</strong> or <strong>0X</strong>.</p>

<h2>Python &minus; Floating Point Numbers</h2>
<p>A floating point number has an integer part and a fractional part, separated by a decimal point symbol (.). By default, the number is positive, prefix a dash (-) symbol for a negative number.</p>
<p>A floating point number is an object of Python's float class. To store a float object, you may use a literal notation, use the value of an arithmetic expression, or use the return value of float() function.</p>
<p>Using literal is the most direct way. Just assign a number with fractional part to a variable. Each of the following statements declares a float object.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> a<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">9.99</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> b<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">0.999</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> c<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">9.99</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> d<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">0.999</span></div>
<p>In Python, there is no restriction on how many digits after the decimal point can a floating point number have. However, to shorten the representation, the <strong>E</strong> or <strong>e</strong> symbol is used. E stands for Ten raised to. For example, E4 is 10 raised to 4 (or 4<sup>th</sup> power of 10), e-3 is 10 raised to -3.</p>
<p>In scientific notation, number has a coefficient and exponent part. The coefficient should be a float greater than or equal to 1 but less than 10. Hence, 1.23E+3, 9.9E-5, and 1E10 are the examples of floats with scientific notation.</p>

<p>The second approach of forming a float object is indirect, using the result of an expression. Here, the quotient of two floats is assigned to a variable, which refers to a float object.</p>

<h2>Python &minus; Complex Numbers</h2>
<p>In this section, we shall know in detail about Complex data type in Python. Complex numbers find their applications in mathematical equations and laws in electromagnetism, electronics, optics, and quantum theory. Fourier transforms use complex numbers. They are Used in calculations with wavefunctions, designing filters, signal integrity in digital electronics, radio astronomy, etc.</p>
<p>A complex number consists of a real part and an imaginary part, separated by either "+" or "&minus;". The real part can be any floating point (or itself a complex number) number. The imaginary part is also a float/complex, but multiplied by an imaginary number.</p>
<p>In mathematics, an imaginary number "i" is defined as the square root of -1 (<span id="MathJax-Element-5-Frame" class="MathJax" style="position: relative;" tabindex="0" data-mathml="&lt;math xmlns=&quot;http://www.w3.org/1998/Math/MathML&quot;&gt;&lt;merror&gt;&lt;mtext&gt;&amp;amp;bsol;sqrt{&amp;#x2212;1}&lt;/mtext&gt;&lt;/merror&gt;&lt;/math&gt;"><span id="MathJax-Span-9" class="math"><span id="MathJax-Span-10" class="noError" style="display: inline-block;">&amp;bsol;sqrt{&minus;1}</span></span><span class="MJX_Assistive_MathML">&amp;bsol;sqrt{&minus;1}</span></span>). Therefore, a complex number is represented as "x+yi", where x is the real part, and "y" is the coefficient of imaginary part.</p>
<p>Quite often, the symbol "j" is used instead of "I" for the imaginary number, to avoid confusion with its usage as current in theory of electricity. Python also uses "j" as the imaginary number. Hence, "x+yj" is the representation of complex number in Python.</p>
<p>Like int or float data type, a complex object can be formed with literal representation or using complex() function. All the following statements form a complex object.</p>

<p>Note that the real part as well as the coefficient of imaginary part have to be floats, and they may be expressed in standard decimal point notation or scientific notation.</p>
<p>Python's <strong>complex()</strong> function helps in forming an object of complex type. The function receives arguments for real and imaginary part, and returns the complex number.</p>
<p>There are two versions of complex() function, with two arguments and with one argument. Use of complex() with two arguments is straightforward. It uses first argument as real part and second as coefficient of imaginary part.</p>

<h1>Python - Control Flow</h1>
<p>By default, the instructions in a computer program are executed in a sequential manner, from top to bottom, or from start to end. However, such sequentially executing programs can perform only simplistic tasks. We would like the program to have a decision-making ability, so that it performs different steps depending on different conditions.</p>
<p>Most programming languages including Python provide functionality to control the flow of execution of instructions. Normally, there are two type of control flow statements.</p>
<p><strong>Decision-making</strong> &minus; The program is able to decide which of the alternative group of instructions to be executed, depending on value of a certain Boolean expression.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates how decision-making statements work &minus;</p>
<img src="/python/images/decision_making_statements.jpg" alt="decision making statements" />
<p><strong>Looping or Iteration</strong> &minus; Most of the processes require a group of instructions to be repeatedly executed. In programming terminology, it is called a <strong>loop</strong>. Instead of the next step, if the flow is redirected towards any earlier step, it constitutes a loop.</p>
<p>The following diagram illustrates how the looping works &minus;</p>
<img src="/python/images/looping_works.jpg" alt="looping_works" />
<p>If the control goes back unconditionally, it forms an infinite loop which is not desired as the rest of the code would never get executed.</p>
<p>In a conditional loop, the repeated iteration of block of statements goes on till a certain condition is met.</p>
<h1>Python - Decision Making</h1>
<p>Python's decision making functionality is in its keywords &minus; if, else and elif. The if keyword requires a boolean expression, followed by colon symbol.</p>
<p>The colon (:) symbol starts an indented block. The statements with the same level of indentation are executed if the boolean expression in if statement is True. If the expression is not True (False), the interpreter bypasses the indented block and proceeds to execute statements at earlier indentation level.</p>
<h2>Python &minus; The if Statement</h2>
<p>The following flowchart illustrates how Python <strong>if statement</strong> works &minus;</p>
<img src="/python/images/if_statement_works.jpg" alt="if statement works" />
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The logic in the above flowchart is expressed by the following syntax &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">if</span> expr<span class="token operator">==</span><span class="token boolean">True</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> stmt1 stmt2 stmt3 <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span> <span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span> Stmt4</div>
<p>The <strong>if</strong> statement is similar to that of other languages. The <strong>if</strong> statement contains a boolean expression using which the data is compared and a decision is made based on the result of the comparison.</p>
<p>If the boolean expression evaluates to True, then the block of statement(s) inside the if statement is executed. In Python, statements in a block are uniformly indented after the ":" symbol. If boolean expression evaluates to False, then the first set of code after the end of block is executed.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us consider an example of a customer entitiled to 10% discount if his purchase amount is &gt;1000; if not, no discount applicable. This flowchart shows the process.</p>
<img src="/python/images/if_flowchart.jpg" alt="if_flowchart" />
<p>In Python, we first set a discount variable to 0 and accept the amount as input from user.</p>
<p>Then comes the conditional statement if amt&gt;1000. Put : symbol that starts conditional block wherein discount applicable is calculated. Obviously, discount or not, next statement by default prints amount-discount. If applied, it will be subtracted, if not it is 0.</p>

<p>Change the variable amount to 800, and run the code again. This time, no discount is applicable. And, you will get the following output &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">amount = 800

<h1>Python - The if-else Statement</h1>
<p>Along with the <strong>if</strong> statement, else keyword can also be optionally used. It provides an alternate block of statements to be executed if the Boolean expression (in if statement) is not true. this flowchart shows how else block is used.</p>
<img src="/python/images/ifelse_syntax.jpg" alt="ifelse syntax" />
<p>If the expr is True, block of stmt1,2,3 is executed then the default flow continues with stmt7. However, the If expr is False, block stmt4,5,6 runs then the default flow continues.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>Python implementation of the above flowchart is as follows &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">if</span> expr<span class="token operator">==</span><span class="token boolean">True</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> stmt1 stmt2 stmt3 <span class="token keyword">else</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> stmt4 stmt5 stmt6 Stmt7</div>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us understand the use of else clause with following example. The variable age can take different values. If the expression "age &gt; 18" is true, message you are eligible to vote is displayed otherwise not eligible message should be displayed. Following flowchart illustrates this logic.</p>
<img src="/python/images/ifelse.jpg" alt="if-else" />
<p>Its Python implementation is simple.</p>

</div>
<p>To begin, set the integer variable "age" to 25.</p>
<p>Then use the <strong>if</strong> statement with "age&gt;18" expression followed by ":" which starts a block; this will come in action if "age&gt;=18" is true.</p>
<p>To provide <strong>else</strong> block, use "else:" the ensuing indented block containing message <strong>not eligible</strong> will be in action when "age&gt;=18" is false.</p>
<p>On executing this code, you will get the following <strong>ouput</strong> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">age: 25
eligible to vote
</pre>
<p>To test the the <strong>else</strong> block, change the <strong>age</strong> to 12, and run the code again.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">age: 12
not eligible to vote
</pre>
<h2>Python &minus; elif Statement</h2>
<p>The <strong>elif</strong> statement allows you to check multiple expressions for TRUE and execute a block of code as soon as one of the conditions evaluates to TRUE.</p>
<p>Similar to the <strong>else</strong> statement, the <strong>elif</strong> statement is optional. However, unlike <strong>else</strong>, for which there can be at the most one statement; there can be an arbitrary number of <strong>elif</strong> statements following an <strong>if</strong>.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>

<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us understand how elif works, with the help of following example.</p>
<p>The discount structure used in an earlier example is modified to different slabs of discount &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>20% on amount exceeding 10000,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>10% for amount between 5-10000,</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5% if it is between 1 to 5000.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>no discount if amount&lt;1000</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following flowchart illustrates these conditions &minus;</p>
<img src="/python/images/ifelif.jpg" alt="if-elif" />
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>We can write a Python code for the above logic with <strong>if-else</strong> statements &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">amount <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token builtin">input</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'Enter amount: '</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">if</span> amount <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token number">10000</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> discount <span class="token operator">=</span> amount <span class="token operator">*</span> <span class="token number">20</span> <span class="token operator">/</span> <span class="token number">100</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">if</span> amount <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token number">5000</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> discount <span class="token operator">=</span> amount <span class="token operator">*</span> <span class="token number">10</span> <span class="token operator">/</span> <span class="token number">100</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">if</span> amount <span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token number">1000</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> discount <span class="token operator">=</span> amount <span class="token operator">*</span> <span class="token number">5</span> <span class="token operator">/</span> <span class="token number">100</span> <span class="token keyword">else</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> dicount <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">0</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'amount: '</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>amount <span class="token operator">-</span> discount<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>While the code will work perfectly ok, if you look at the increasing level of indentation at each if and else statement, it will become difficult to manage if there are still more conditions.</p>
<p>The <strong>elif</strong> statement makes the code easy to read and comprehend.</p>
<p><strong>Elif</strong> is short for "else if". It allows the logic to be arranged in a cascade of <strong>elif</strong> statements after the first if statement. If the first <strong>if</strong> statement evaluates to false, subsequent elif statements are evaluated one by one and comes out of the cascade if any one is satisfied.</p>
<p>Last in the cascade is the <strong>else</strong> block which will come in picture when all preceding if/elif conditions fail.</p>

<h2>Nested If Statements</h2>
<p>There may be a situation when you want to check for another condition after a condition resolves to true. In such a situation, you can use the nested <strong>if</strong> construct.</p>
<p>In a nested if construct, you can have an if...elif...else construct inside another if...elif...else construct.</p>

<h1>Python - MatchCase Statement</h1>
<p>Before its 3.10 version, Python lacked a feature similar to switch-case in C or C++. In Python 3.10, a pattern matching technique called match-case has been introduced, which is similar to the "switch case" construct.</p>
<p>A <strong>match</strong> statement takes an expression and compares its value to successive patterns given as one or more case blocks. The usage is more similar to pattern matching in languages like Rust or Haskell than a switch statement in C or C++. Only the first pattern that matches gets executed. It is also possible to extract components (sequence elements or object attributes) from the value into variables.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The basic usage of match-case is to compare a variable against one or more values.</p>

<p>The last case statement in the function has "_" as the value to compare. It serves as the wildcard case, and will be executed if all other cases are not true.</p>
<h3>Combined Cases</h3>
<p>Sometimes, there may be a situation where for more thanone cases, a similar action has to be taken. For this, you can combine cases with the OR operator represented by "|" symbol.</p>

<h2>Using "if" in "Case" Clause</h2>
<p>Normally Python matches an expression against literal cases. However, it allows you to include if statement in the case clause for conditional computation of match variable.</p>
<p>In the following example, the function argument is a list of amount and duration, and the intereset is to be calculated for amount less than or more than 10000. The condition is included in the <strong>case</strong> clause.</p>

<h1>Python - The for Loop</h1>
<p>The <strong>for</strong> loop in Python has the ability to iterate over the items of any sequence, such as a list or a string.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">for</span> iterating_var <span class="token keyword">in</span> sequence<span class="token punctuation">:</span> statements<span class="token punctuation">(</span>s<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>If a sequence contains an expression list, it is evaluated first. Then, the first item (at 0th index) in the sequence is assigned to the iterating variable iterating_var.</p>
<p>Next, the statements block is executed. Each item in the list is assigned to iterating_var, and the statement(s) block is executed until the entire sequence is exhausted.</p>
<p>The following flow diagram illustrates the working of <strong>for</strong> loop &minus;</p>
<img src="/python/images/forloop.jpg" alt="forloop" />
<p>Since the loop is executed for each member element in a sequence, there is no need for explicit verification of Boolean expression controlling the loop (as in <strong>while</strong> loop).</p>
<p>The sequence objects such as list, tuple or string are called <strong>iterables</strong>, as the for loop iterates through the collection. Any iterator object can be iterated by the <strong>for</strong> loop.</p>
<p>The view objects returned by items(), keys() and values() methods of dictionary are also iterables, hence we can run a <strong>for</strong> loop with them.</p>
<p>Python's built-in range() function returns an iterator object that streams a sequence of numbers. We can run a for loop with range.</p>
<h2>Using "for" with a String</h2>
<p>A string is a sequence of Unicode letters, each having a positional index. The following example compares each character and displays if it is not a vowel ('a', 'e', 'I', 'o' or 'u')</p>

<h1>Python - The forelse Loop</h1>
<p>Python supports having an "else" statement associated with a "for" loop statement. If the "else" statement is used with a "for" loop, the "else" statement is executed when the sequence is exhausted before the control shifts to the main line of execution.</p>
<p>The following flow diagram illustrates how to use <strong>else</strong> statement with <strong>for</strong> loop &minus;</p>
<img src="/python/images/forelse.jpg" alt="for-else" />
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following example illustrates the combination of an else statement with a for statement. Till the count is less than 5, the iteration count is printed. As it becomes 5, the print statement in else block is executed, before the control is passed to the next statement in the main program.</p>

<h2>Nested Loops</h2>
<p>Python programming language allows the use of one loop inside another loop. The following section shows a few examples to illustrate the concept.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>

<p>The syntax for a nested <strong>while</strong> loop statement in Python programming language is as follows &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">while</span> expression<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">while</span> expression<span class="token punctuation">:</span> statement<span class="token punctuation">(</span>s<span class="token punctuation">)</span> statement<span class="token punctuation">(</span>s<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>A final note on loop nesting is that you can put any type of loop inside any other type of loop. For example a for loop can be inside a while loop or vice versa.</p>

<h1>Python - The while Loop</h1>
<p>Normally, flow of execution of steps in a computer program goe from start to end. However, instead of the next step, if the flow is redirected towards any earlier step, it constitutes a loop.</p>
<p>A <strong>while</strong> loop statement in Python programming language repeatedly executes a target statement as long as a given boolean expression is true.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The syntax of a <strong>while</strong> loop in Python programming language is &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">while</span> expression<span class="token punctuation">:</span> statement<span class="token punctuation">(</span>s<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>The <strong>while</strong> keyword is followed by a boolean expression, and then by colon symbol, to start an indented block of statements. Here, statement(s) may be a single statement or a block of statements with uniform indent. The condition may be any expression, and true is any non-zero value. The loop iterates while the boolean expression is true.</p>
<p>As soon as the expression becomes false, the program control passes to the line immediately following the loop.</p>
<p>If it fails to turn false, the loop continues to run, and doesn't stop unless forcefully stopped. Such a loop is called infinite loop, which is undesired in a computer program.</p>
<p>The following flow diagram illustrates the <strong>while</strong> loop &minus;</p>
<img src="/python/images/while.jpg" alt="output hello world" />
<h3>Example 1</h3>
<p>In Python, all the statements indented by the same number of character spaces after a programming construct are considered to be part of a single block of code. Python uses indentation as its method of grouping statements.</p>

<p>We initialize count variable to 0, and the loop runs till "count&lt;5". In each iteration, count is incremented and checked. If it's not 5 next repetion takes place. Inside the looping block, instantenous value of count is printed. When the <strong>while</strong> condition becomes false, the loop terminates, and next statement is executed, here it is End of <strong>while</strong> loop message.</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>On executing, this code will produce the following output &minus;</p>

<h3>Example 2</h3>
<p>Here is another example of using the <strong>while</strong> loop. For each iteration, the program asks for user input and keeps repeating till the user inputs a non-numeric string. The isnumeric() function that returns true if input is an integer, false otherwise.</p>

<h2>The Infinite Loop</h2>
<p>A loop becomes infinite loop if a condition never becomes FALSE. You must be cautious when using while loops because of the possibility that this condition never resolves to a FALSE value. This results in a loop that never ends. Such a loop is called an infinite loop.</p>
<p>An infinite loop might be useful in client/server programming where the server needs to run continuously so that client programs can communicate with it as and when required.</p>

<p>The above example goes in an infinite loop and you need to use CTRL+C to exit the program.</p>
<h2>The while-else Loop</h2>
<p>Python supports having an <strong>else</strong> statement associated with a <strong>while</strong> loop statement.</p>
<p>If the <strong>else</strong> statement is used with a <strong>while</strong> loop, the <strong>else</strong> statement is executed when the condition becomes false before the control shifts to the main line of execution.</p>

<h1>Python - The break Statement</h1>
<h2>Loop Control Statements</h2>
<p>The Loop control statements change the execution from its normal sequence. When the execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>
<p>Python supports the following control statements &minus;</p>
<table class="table table-bordered">

<tr>
<th>Sr.No.</th>
<th style="text-align: center;">Control Statement &amp; Description</th>

<td>
<p>pass statement</p>
<p>The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>Let us go through the loop control statements briefly.</p>
<h2>Python &minus; The break Statement</h2>
<p>The <strong>break</strong> statement is used for premature termination of the current loop. After abandoning the loop, execution at the next statement is resumed, just like the traditional break statement in C.</p>
<p>The most common use of break is when some external condition is triggered requiring a hasty exit from a loop. The <strong>break</strong> statement can be used in both while and for loops.</p>
<p>If you are using nested loops, the break statement stops the execution of the innermost loop and starts executing the next line of the code after the block.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<p>The syntax for a <strong>break</strong> statement in Python is as follows &minus;</p>

<h3>Example 3: Checking for Prime Number</h3>
<p>Note that when the break statement is encountered, Python abandons the remaining statements in the loop, including the <strong>else</strong> block.</p>
<p>The following example takes advantage of this behaviour to find whether a number is prime or not. By definition, a number is prime if it is not divisible by any other number except 1 and itself.</p>
<p>The following code runs a <strong>for</strong> loop over numbers from 2 to the desired number-1. If it divisible by any value of looping variable, the number is not prime, hence the program breaks from the loop. If the number is not divisible by any number between 2 and x-1, the else block prints the message that the given number is prime.</p>

<h1>Python - The Continue Statement</h1>
<p>The <strong>continue</strong> statement in Python returns the control to the beginning of the current loop. When encountered, the loop starts next iteration without executing the remaining statements in the current iteration.</p>
<p>The continue statement can be used in both <strong>while</strong> and <strong>for</strong> loops.</p>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">continue</span></div>
<h3>Flow Diagram</h3>
<p>The flow diagram of the <strong>continue</strong> statement looks like this &minus;</p>
<img src="/python/images/loop_continue.jpg" alt="loop-continue" />
<p>The <strong>continue</strong> statement is just the opposite to that of <strong>break</strong>. It skips the remaining statements in the current loop and starts the next iteration.</p>

<h1>Python - The pass Statement</h1>
<p>The <strong>pass</strong> statement is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.</p>
<p>The <strong>pass</strong> statement is a null operation; nothing happens when it executes. The <strong>pass</strong> statement is also useful in places where your code will eventually go, but has not been written yet, i.e., in stubs).</p>

<h1>Python - Functions</h1>
<p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>
<p>A top-to-down approach towards building the processing logic involves defining blocks of independent reusable functions. A function may be invoked from any other function by passing required data (called <strong>parameters</strong> or <strong>arguments</strong>). The called function returns its result back to the calling environment.</p>
<img src="/python/images/python_functions.jpg" alt="python functions" />
<h2>Types of Python Functions</h2>
<p>Python provides the following types of functions &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>Built-in functions</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Functions defined in built-in modules</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>User-defined functions</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Python's standard library includes number of built-in functions. Some of Python's built-in functions are print(), int(), len(), sum(), etc. These functions are always available, as they are loaded into computer's memory as soon as you start Python interpreter.</p>
<p>The standard library also bundles a number of modules. Each module defines a group of functions. These functions are not readily available. You need to import them into the memory from their respective modules.</p>
<p>In addition to the built-in functions and functions in the built-in modules, you can also create your own functions. These functions are called user-defined <em>functions</em>.</p>
<h2>Python Defining a Function</h2>
<p>You can define custom functions to provide the required functionality. Here are simple rules to define a function in Python.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>Function blocks begin with the keyword <strong>def</strong> followed by the function name and parentheses ( ( ) ).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Any input parameters or arguments should be placed within these parentheses. You can also define parameters inside these parentheses.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The first statement of a function can be an optional statement; the documentation string of the function or docstring.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The code block within every function starts with a colon (:) and is indented.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The statement <strong>return [expression]</strong> exits a function, optionally passing back an expression to the caller. A <strong>return</strong> statement with no arguments is the same as return None.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Syntax</h3>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">functionname</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span> parameters <span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"function_docstring"</span> function_suite <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span>expression<span class="token punctuation">]</span></div>
<p>By default, parameters have a positional behavior and you need to inform them in the same order that they were defined.</p>
<p>Once the function is defined, you can execute it by calling it from another function or directly from the Python prompt.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following example shows how to define a function greetings(). The bracket is empty so there aren't any parameters.</p>
<p>The first line is the docstring. Function block ends with return statement. when this function is called, <strong>Hello world</strong> message will be printed.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">greetings</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"This is docstring of greetings function"</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hello World"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> greetings<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<h2>Calling a Function</h2>
<p>Defining a function only gives it a name, specifies the parameters that are to be included in the function and structures the blocks of code.</p>
<p>Once the basic structure of a function is finalized, you can execute it by calling it from another function or directly from the Python prompt. Following is the example to call printme() function &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token comment"># Function definition is here</span> <span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">printme</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span> <span class="token builtin">str</span> <span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"This prints a passed string into this function"</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token builtin">str</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span><span class="token punctuation">;</span> <span class="token comment"># Now you can call printme function</span> printme<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"I'm first call to user defined function!"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> printme<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Again second call to the same function"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>When the above code is executed, it produces the following <strong>output</strong> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">I'm first call to user defined function!
Again second call to the same function
</pre>
<h2>Pass by Reference vs Value</h2>
<p>The <strong>function calling mechanism</strong> of Python differs from that of C and C++. There are two main function calling mechanisms: <strong>Call by Value</strong> and <strong>Call by Reference</strong>.</p>
<p>When a variable is passed to a function, what does the function do to it? If any changes to its variable doesnot get reflected in the actual argument, then it uses call by value mechanism. On the other hand, if the change is reflected, then it becomes call by reference mechanism.</p>
<img src="/python/images/pass_by_reference_vs_value.jpg" alt="Pass By Reference Vs Value" />
<p><strong>C/C++ functions are said to be called by value</strong>. When a function in C/C++ is called, the value of actual arguments is copied to the variables representing the formal arguments. If the function modifies the value of formal aergument, it doesn't reflect the variable that was passed to it.</p>
<p><strong>Python uses pass by reference mechanism</strong>. As variable in Python is a label or reference to the object in the memory, the both the variables used as actual argument as well as formal arguments really refer to the same object in the memory. We can verify this fact by checking the id() of the passed variable before and after passing.</p>

</div>
<p>If the above code is executed, the id() before passing and inside the function is same.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">ID before passing: 1996838294128
ID inside the function: 1996838294128
</pre>
<p>The behaviour also depends on whether the passed object is mutable or immutable. Python numeric object is immutable. When a numeric object is passed, and then the function changes the value of the formal argument, it actually creates a new object in the memory, leaving the original variable unchanged.</p>

<p>Let us now pass a mutable object (such as a list or dictionary) to a function. It is also passed by reference, as the id() of lidt before and after passing is same. However, if we modify the list inside the function, its global representation also reflects the change.</p>

<h2>Function Arguments</h2>
<p>The process of a function often depends on certain data provided to it while calling it. While defining a function, you must give a list of variables in which the data passed to it is collected. The variables in the parentheses are called formal arguments.</p>
<p>When the function is called, value to each of the formal arguments must be provided. Those are called actual arguments.</p>
<img src="/python/images/function_arguments.jpg" alt="function arguments" />
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let's modify greetings function and have name an argument. A string passed to it whilcalling becomes name variable inside the function.</p>

</div>
<p>It will produce the following <strong>output</strong> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">Hello Samay
Hello Pratima
Hello Steven
</pre>
<h2>Function with Return Value</h2>
<p>The <strong>return</strong> keyword as the last statement in function definition indicates end of function block, and the program flow goes back to the calling function. Although reduced indent after the last statement in the block also implies return but using explicit return is a good practice.</p>
<p>Along with the flow control, the function can also return value of an expression to the calling function. The value of returned expression can be stored in a variable for further processing.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Let us define the add() function. It adds the two values passed to it and returns the addition. The returned value is stored in a variable called result.</p>

<h2>Types of Function Arguments</h2>
<p>Based on how the arguments are declared while defining a Python function, there are classified into the following categories &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>Positional or required arguments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keyword arguments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Default arguments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Positional-only arguments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Keyword-only arguments</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Arbitrary or variable-length arguments</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the next few chapters, we will discuss these function arguments at length.</p>
<h2>Order of Arguments</h2>
<p>A function can have arguments of any of the types defined above. However, the arguments must be declared in the following order &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>The argument list begins with the positional-only args, followed by the slash (/) symbol.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>It is followed by regular positional args that may or may not be called as keyword arguments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Then there may be one or more args with default values.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Next, arbitrary positional arguments represented by a variable prefixed with single asterisk, that is treated as tuple. It is the next.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If the function has any keyword-only arguments, put an asterisk before their names start. Some of the keyword-only arguments may have a default value.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Last in the bracket is argument with two asterisks ** to accept arbitrary number of keyword arguments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The following diagram shows the order of formal arguments &minus;</p>
<img src="/python/images/order_of_formal_arguments.jpg" alt="Order Of Formal Arguments" />
<h1>Python - Default Arguments</h1>
<p>You can define a function with default value assigned to one or more formal arguments. Python uses the default value for such an argument if no value is passed to it. If any value is passed, the default is overridden.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<div class="code-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">

</div>
<p>It will produce the following <strong>output</strong> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">Name: miki
Age 50
Name: miki
Age 35
</pre>
<p>In the above example, the second call to the function doesn't pass value to age argument, hence its default value 35 is used.</p>
<p>Let us look at another example that assigns default value to a function argument. The function percent() is defined as below &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">percent</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>phy<span class="token punctuation">,</span> maths<span class="token punctuation">,</span> maxmarks<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">200</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> val <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>phy<span class="token operator">+</span>maths<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">*</span><span class="token number">100</span><span class="token operator">/</span>maxmarks <span class="token keyword">return</span> val</div>
<p>Assuming that marks given for each subject are out of 100, the argument maxmarks is set to 200. Hence, we can omit the value of third argument while calling percent() function.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">phy <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">60</span> maths <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">70</span> result <span class="token operator">=</span> percent<span class="token punctuation">(</span>phy<span class="token punctuation">,</span>maths<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>However, if maximum marks for each subject is not 100, then we need to put the third argument while calling the percent() function.</p>

<h1>Python - Keyword Arguments</h1>
<p>Keyword argument are also called named arguments. Variables in the function definition are used as keywords. When the function is called, you can explicitly mention the name and its value.</p>

</div>
<p>By default, the function assigns the values to arguments in the order of appearance. In the second function call, we have assigned the value to a specific argument</p>
<p>It will produce the following <strong>output</strong> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">Name: Naveen

<p>Instead ofpassing the values with positional arguments, let us call the function with keyword arguments &minus;</p>

<pre class="result notranslate">num:10 den:5 quotient:2.0
num:10 den:5 quotient:2.0
</pre>
<p>When using keyword arguments, it is not necessary to follow the order of formal arguments in function definition.</p>
<p>Using keyword arguments is optional. You can use mixed calling. You can pass values to some arguments without keywords, and for others with keyword.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">division<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> den<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">5</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>However, the positional arguments must be before the keyword arguments while using mixed calling.</p>
<p>Try to call the division() function with the following statement.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">division<span class="token punctuation">(</span>num<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token number">5</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>As the Positional argument cannot appear after keyword arguments, Python raises the following error message &minus;</p>

<h1>Python - Keyword-Only Arguments</h1>
<p>You can use the variables in formal argument list as keywords to pass value. Use of keyword arguments is optional. But, you can force the function be given arguments by keyword only. You should put an astreisk (*) before the keyword-only arguments list.</p>
<p>Let us say we have a function with three arguments, out of which we want second and third arguments to be keyword-only. For that, put * after the first argument.</p>
<p>The built-in print() function is an example of keyword-only arguments. You can give list of expressions to be printed in the parentheses. The printed values are separated by a white space by default. You can specify any other separation character instead with sep argument.</p>

<h1>Python - Arbitrary Arguments</h1>
<p>You may want to define a function that is able to accept arbitrary or variable number of arguments. Moreover, the arbitrary number of arguments might be positional or keyword arguments.</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>An argument prefixed with a single asterisk * for arbitrary positional arguments.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An argument prefixed with two asterisks ** for arbitrary keyword arguments.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Given below is an example of arbitrary or variable length positional arguments &minus;</p>

</div>
<p>The <strong>args</strong> variable prefixed with "*" stores all the values passed to it. Here, args becomes a tuple. We can run a loop over its items to add the numbers.</p>
<p>It will produce the following <strong>output</strong> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">100
6
</pre>
<p>It is also possible to have a function with some required arguments before the sequence of variable number of values.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following example has <strong>avg()</strong> function. Assume that a student can take any number of tests. First test is mandatory. He can take as many tests as he likes to better his score. The function calculates the average of marks in first test and his maximum score in the rest of tests.</p>
<p>The function has two arguments, first is the required argument and second to hold any number of values.</p>

</div>
<p>Following call to avg() function passes first value to the required argument first, and the remaining values to a tuple named rest. We then find the maximum and use it to calculate the average.</p>
<p>It will produce the following <strong>output</strong> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">45.0
</pre>
<p>If a variable in the argument list has two asterisks prefixed to it, the function can accept arbitrary number of keyword arguments. The variable becomes a dictionary of keyword:value pairs.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>The following code is an example of a function with arbitrary keyword arguments. The addr() function has an argument **kwargs which is able to accept any number of address elements like name, city, phno, pin, etc. Inside the function kwargs dictionary of kw:value pairs is traversed using items() method.</p>

<p>If the function uses mixed types of arguments, the arbitrary keyword arguments should be after positional, keyword and arbitrary positional arguments in the argument list.</p>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Imagine a case where science and maths are mandatory subjects, in addition to which student may choose any number of elective subjects.</p>
<p>The following code defines a <strong>percent()</strong> function where marks in science and marks are stored in required arguments, and the marks in variable number of elective subjects in **optional argument.</p>

<h1>Python - Variable Scope</h1>
<p>A variable in Python is a symbols name to the object in computer's memory. Python works on the concept of namespaces to define the context for various identifiers such as functions, variables etc. A namespace is a collection of symbolic names defined in the current context.</p>
<p>Python provides the following types of namespaces &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p><strong>Built-in namespace</strong> contains built-in functions and built-in exceptions. They are loaded in the memory as soon as Python interpreter is loaded and remain till the interpreter is running.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Global namespace</strong> contains any names defined in the main program. These names remain in memory till the program is running.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Local namespace</strong> contains names defined inside a function. They are available till the function is running.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These namespaces are nested one inside the other. Following diagram shows relationship between namespaces.</p>
<img src="/python/images/types_of_namespace.jpg" alt="Types Of Namespace" />
<p>The life of a certain variable is restricted to the namespace in which it is defined. As a result, it is not possible to access a variable present in the inner namespace from any outer namespace.</p>
<h2>globals() Function</h2>
<p>Python's standard library includes a built-in function globals(). It returns a dictionary of symbols currently available in global namespace.</p>
<p>Run the globals() function directly from the Python prompt.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">&gt;&gt;&gt; globals()
{'__name__': '__main__', '__doc__': None, '__package__': None, '__loader__': &lt;class '_frozen_importlib.BuiltinImporter'&gt;, '__spec__': None, '__annotations__': {}, '__builtins__': &lt;module 'builtins' (built-in)&gt;}
</pre>
<p>It can be seen that the builtins module which contains definitions of all built-in functions and built-in exceptions is loaded.</p>
<p>Save the following code that contains few variables and a function with few more variables inside it.</p>

</pre>
<p>The global namespace now contains variables in the program and their values and the function object in it (and not the variables in the function).</p>
<h2>locals() Function</h2>
<p>Python's standard library includes a built-in function locals(). It returns a dictionary of symbols currently available in namespace of the function.</p>

<h1>Python - Function Annotations</h1>
<p>The function annotation feature of Python enables you to add additional explanatory metada about the arguments declared in a function definition, and also the return data type.</p>
<p>Although you can use the docstring feature of Python for documentation of a function, it may be obsolete if certain changes in the function's prototype are made. Hence, the annotation feature was introduced in Python as a result of PEP 3107.</p>
<p>The annotations are not considered by Python interpreter while executing the function. They are mainly for the Python IDEs for providing a detailed documentation to the programmer.</p>
<p>Annotations are any valid Python expressions added to the arguments or return data type. Simplest example of annotation is to prescribe the data type of the arguments. Annotation is mentioned as an expression after putting a colon in front of the argument.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">myfunction</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> b<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> c <span class="token operator">=</span> a<span class="token operator">+</span>b <span class="token keyword">return</span> c</div>
<p>Remember that Python is a dynamically typed language, and doesn't enforce any type checking at runtime. Hence annotating the arguments with data types doesn't have any effect while calling the function. Even if non-integer arguments are given, Python doesn't detect any error.</p>

Hello Python
</pre>
<p>Annotations are ignored at runtime, but are helpful for the IDEs and static type checker libraries such as mypy.</p>
<p>You can give annotation for the return data type as well. After the parentheses and before the colon symbol, put an arrow (-&gt;) followed by the annotation. For example &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">myfunction</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> b<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> c <span class="token operator">=</span> a<span class="token operator">+</span>b <span class="token keyword">return</span> c</div>
<p>As using the data type as annotation is ignored at runtime, you can put any expression which acts as the metadata for the arguments. Hence, function may have any arbitrary expression as annotation as in following example &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">total</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x <span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'marks in Physics'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> y<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">'marks in chemistry'</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> x<span class="token operator">+</span>y</div>
<p>If you want to specify a default argument along with the annotation, you need to put it after the annotation expression. Default arguments must come after the required arguments in the argument list.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">myfunction</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>a<span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token string">"physics"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> b<span class="token punctuation">:</span><span class="token string">"Maths"</span> <span class="token operator">=</span> <span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">int</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> c <span class="token operator">=</span> a<span class="token operator">+</span>b <span class="token keyword">return</span> c <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>myfunction<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>

<h1>Python - Modules</h1>
<p>A function is a block of organized, reusable code that is used to perform a single, related action. Functions provide better modularity for your application and a high degree of code reusing.</p>
<p>The concept of module in Python further enhances the modularity. You can define more than one related functions together and load required functions. A module is a file containing definition of functions, classes, variables, constants or any other Python object. Contents of this file can be made available to any other program. Python has the import keyword for this purpose.</p>

<h2>Built in Modules</h2>
<p>Python's standard library comes bundled with a large number of modules. They are called built-in modules. Most of these built-in modules are written in C (as the reference implementation of Python is in C), and pre-compiled into the library. These modules pack useful functionality like system-specific OS management, disk IO, networking, etc.</p>
<p>Here is a select list of built-in modules &minus;</p>

<h2>User Defined Modules</h2>
<p>Any text file with .py extension and containing Python code is basically a module. It can contain definitions of one or more functions, variables, constants as well as classes. Any Python object from a module can be made available to interpreter session or another Python script by import statement. A module can also include runnable code.</p>
<h2>Create a Module</h2>
<p>Creating a module is nothing but saving a Python code with the help of any editor. Let us save the following code as <strong>mymodule.py</strong></p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">SayHello</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>name<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hi {}!

<p>You can now import mymodule in the current Python terminal.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">import</span> mymodule <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> mymodule<span class="token punctuation">.</span>SayHello<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Harish"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> Hi Harish! How are you?</div>
<p>You can also import one module in another Python script. Save the following code as example.py</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">import</span> mymodule mymodule<span class="token punctuation">.</span>SayHello<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Harish"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>

<h2>The import Statement</h2>
<p>In Python, the <strong>import</strong> keyword has been provided to load a Python object from one module. The object may be a function, class, a variable etc. If a module contains multiple definitions, all of them will be loaded in the namespace.</p>
<p>Let us save the following code having three functions as <strong>mymodule.py.</strong></p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">sum</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token punctuation">,</span>y<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> x<span class="token operator">+</span>y <span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">average</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token punctuation">,</span>y<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token operator">+</span>y<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">/</span><span class="token number">2</span> <span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">power</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token punctuation">,</span>y<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> x<span class="token operator">**</span>y</div>
<p>The <strong>import mymodule</strong> statement loads all the functions in this module in the current namespace. Each function in the imported module is an attribute of this module object.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token builtin">dir</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>mymodule<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token string">'__builtins__'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'__cached__'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'__doc__'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'__file__'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'__loader__'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'__name__'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'__package__'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'__spec__'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'average'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'power'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token string">'sum'</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span></div>
<p>To call any function, use the module object's reference. For example, mymodule.sum().</p>

<h2>The from ... import Statement</h2>
<p>The import statement will load all the resources of the module in the current namespace. It is possible to import specific objects from a module by using this syntax. For example &minus;</p>
<p>Out of three functions in <strong>mymodule</strong>, only two are imported in following executable script <strong>example.py</strong></p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">from</span> mymodule <span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token builtin">sum</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> average <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"sum:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token builtin">sum</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"average:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>average<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>It will produce the following output &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">sum: 30
average: 15.0
</pre>
<p>Note that function need not be called by prefixing name of its module to it.</p>
<h2>The from...import * Statement</h2>
<p>It is also possible to import all the names from a module into the current namespace by using the following import statement &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">from</span> modname <span class="token keyword">import</span> <span class="token operator">*</span></div>
<p>This provides an easy way to import all the items from a module into the current namespace; however, this statement should be used sparingly.</p>
<h2>The import ... as Statement</h2>
<p>You can assign an alias name to the imported module.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">from</span> modulename <span class="token keyword">as</span> alias</div>
<p>The <strong>alias</strong> should be prefixed to the function while calling.</p>
<p>Take a look at the following <strong>example</strong> &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">import</span> mymodule <span class="token keyword">as</span> x <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"sum:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>x<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token builtin">sum</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"average:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> x<span class="token punctuation">.</span>average<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"power:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> x<span class="token punctuation">.</span>power<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token number">2</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<h2>Module Attributes</h2>
<p>In Python, a module is an object of module class, and hence it is characterized by attributes.</p>
<p>Following are the module attributes &minus;</p>
<ul class="list">
<li>
<p>__file__ returns the physical name of the module.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>__package__ returns the package to which the module belongs.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>__doc__ returns the docstring at the top of the module if any</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>__dict__ returns the entire scope of the module</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>__name__ returns the name of the module</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Example</h3>
<p>Assuming that the following code is saved as <strong>mymodule.py</strong></p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token string">"The docstring of mymodule"</span> <span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">sum</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token punctuation">,</span>y<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> x<span class="token operator">+</span>y <span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">average</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token punctuation">,</span>y<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token operator">+</span>y<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">/</span><span class="token number">2</span> <span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">power</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token punctuation">,</span>y<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> x<span class="token operator">**</span>y</div>
<p>Let us check the attributes of mymodule by importing it in the following script &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">import</span> mymodule <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"__file__ attribute:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> mymodule<span class="token punctuation">.</span>__file__<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"__doc__ attribute:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> mymodule<span class="token punctuation">.</span>__doc__<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"__name__ attribute:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> mymodule<span class="token punctuation">.</span>__name__<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>It will produce the following <strong>output</strong> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">__file__ attribute: C:\Users\mlath\examples\mymodule.py
__doc__ attribute: The docstring of mymodule
__name__ attribute: mymodule
</pre>
<h2>The __name__Attribute</h2>
<p>The __name__ attribute of a Python module has great significance. Let us explore it in more detail.</p>
<p>In an interactive shell, __name__ attribute returns '__main__'</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> __name__ <span class="token string">'__main__'</span></div>
<p>If you import any module in the interpreter session, it returns the name of the module as the __name__ attribute of that module.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">import</span> math <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> math<span class="token punctuation">.</span>__name__ <span class="token string">'math'</span></div>
<p>From inside a Python script, the __name__ attribute returns '__main__'</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token comment">#example.py</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"__name__ attribute within a script:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> __name__<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>Run this in the command terminal &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">__name__ attribute within a script<span class="token punctuation">:</span> __main__</div>
<p>This attribute allows a Python script to be used as executable or as a module. Unlike in C++, Java, C# etc., in Python, there is no concept of the main() function. The Python program script with .py extension can contain function definitions as well as executable statements.</p>
<p>Save <strong>mymodule.py</strong> and with the following code &minus;</p>
<div class="code-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">
<div class="logo-side">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="button-side">
<div class="execute">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="open-compiler">Open Compiler</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token string">"The docstring of mymodule"</span> <span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">sum</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token punctuation">,</span>y<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> x<span class="token operator">+</span>y <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"sum:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token builtin">sum</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
</div>
<p>You can see that sum() function is called within the same script in which it is defined.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">C:\Users\user\examples&gt; python mymodule.py
sum: 30
</pre>
<p>Now let us import this function in another script <strong>example.py</strong>.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">import</span> mymodule <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"sum:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>mymodule<span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token builtin">sum</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>It will produce the following <strong>output</strong> &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">C:\Users\user\examples&gt; python example.py
sum: 30
sum: 30
</pre>
<p>The output "sum:30" appears twice. Once when mymodule module is imported. The executable statements in imported module are also run. Second output is from the calling script, i.e., <strong>example.py</strong> program.</p>
<p>What we want to happen is that when a module is imported, only the function should be imported, its executable statements should not run. This can be done by checking the value of __name__. If it is __main__, means it is being run and not imported. Include the executable statements like function calls conditionally.</p>
<p>Add <strong>if</strong> statement in <strong>mymodule.py</strong> as shown &minus;</p>
<div class="code-wrapper">
<div class="code-header">
<div class="logo-side">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="button-side">
<div class="execute">&nbsp;</div>
<div class="open-compiler">Open Compiler</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token string">"The docstring of mymodule"</span> <span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">sum</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>x<span class="token punctuation">,</span>y<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span> x<span class="token operator">+</span>y <span class="token keyword">if</span> __name__ <span class="token operator">==</span> <span class="token string">"__main__"</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"sum:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token builtin">sum</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">10</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token number">20</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
</div>
<p>Now if you run <strong>example.py</strong> program, you will find that the sum:30 output appears only once.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">C:\Users\user\examples&gt; python example.py
sum: 30
</pre>
<h2>The reload() Function</h2>
<p>Sometimes you may need to reload a module, especially when working with the interactive interpreter session of Python.</p>
<p>Assume that we have a test module (test.py) with the following function &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">SayHello</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>name<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hi {}! How are you?"</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token builtin">format</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>name<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span></div>
<p>We can import the module and call its function from Python prompt as &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">&gt;&gt;&gt; import test
&gt;&gt;&gt; test.SayHello("Deepak")
Hi Deepak! How are you?
</pre>
<p>However, suppose you need to modify the SayHello() function, such as &minus;</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">def</span> <span class="token function">SayHello</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>name<span class="token punctuation">,</span> course<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Hi {}! How are you?"</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token builtin">format</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>name<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"Welcome to {} Tutorial by TutorialsPoint"</span><span class="token punctuation">.</span><span class="token builtin">format</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>course<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">return</span></div>
<p>Even if you edit the test.py file and save it, the function loaded in the memory won't update. You need to reload it, using reload() function in imp module.</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">&gt;&gt;&gt; import imp
&gt;&gt;&gt; imp.reload(test)
&gt;&gt;&gt; test.SayHello("Deepak", "Python")
Hi Deepak! How are you?

<h1>Python - Strings</h1>
<p>In Python, a string is an immutable sequence of Unicode characters. Each character has a unique numeric value as per the UNICODE standard. But, the sequence as a whole, doesn't have any numeric value even if all the characters are digits. To differentiate the string from numbers and other identifiers, the sequence of characters is included within single, double or triple quotes in its literal representation. Hence, 1234 is a number (integer) but '1234' is a string.</p>
<p>As long as the same sequence of characters is enclosed, single or double or triple quotes don't matter. Hence, following string representations are equivalent.</p>

<h1>Python Slicing Strings</h1>
<p>In Python, a string is an ordered sequence of Unicode characters. Each character in the string has a unique index in the sequence. The index starts with 0. First character in the string has its positional index 0. The index keeps incrementing towards the end of string.</p>
<p>If a string variable is declared as var="HELLO PYTHON", index of each character in the string is as follows &minus;</p>
<img src="https://www.tutorialspoint.com/python/images/string_variable.jpg" alt="string_variable" />
<p>Python allows you to access any individual character from the string by its index. In this case, 0 is the lower bound and 11 is the upper bound of the string. So, var[0] returns H, var[6] returns P. If the index in square brackets exceeds the upper bound, Python raises IndexError.</p>

<p>One of the unique features of Python sequence types (and therefore a string object) it has a negative indexing scheme also. In the example above, a positive indexing scheme is used where the index increments from left to right. In case of negative indexing, the character at the end has -1 index and the index decrements from right to left, as a result the first character H has -12 index.</p>
<img src="/python/images/negative_indexing.jpg" alt="negative indexing" />
<p>Let us use negative indexing to fetch N, Y, and H characters.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> var<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token string">'N'</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> var<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">5</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token string">'Y'</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> var<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">12</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> <span class="token string">'H'</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> var<span class="token punctuation">[</span><span class="token operator">-</span><span class="token number">13</span><span class="token punctuation">]</span> Traceback <span class="token punctuation">(</span>most recent call last<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> File <span class="token string">"&lt;stdin&gt;"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> line <span class="token number">1</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> <span class="token keyword">in</span> <span class="token operator">&lt;</span>module<span class="token operator">&gt;</span> IndexError<span class="token punctuation">:</span> string index out of <span class="token builtin">range</span></div>
<p>Once again, if the index goes beyond the range, IndexError is encountered.</p>
<p>We can therefore use positive or negative index to retrieve a character from the string.</p>

<p>In Python, string is an immutable object. The object is immutable if it cannot be modified in-place, once stored in a certain memory location. You can retrieve any character from the string with the help of its index, but you cannot replace it with another character. In our example, character Y is at index 7 in HELLO PYTHON. Try to replace Y with y and see what happens.</p>

<p>The TypeError is because the string is immutable.</p>
<p>Python defines ":" as string slicing operator. It returns a substring from the original string. Its general usage is &minus;</p>

<p>The ":" operator needs two integer operands (both of which may be omitted, as we shall see in subsequent examples). The first operand x is the index of the first character of the desired slice. The second operand y is the index of the character next to the last in the desired string. So var(x:y] separates characters from xth position to (y-1)th position from the original string.</p>

<h1>Python - Modify Strings</h1>
<p>In Python, a string (object of <strong>str</strong> class) is of immutable type. An immutable object is the one which can be modified in place, one created in the memory. Hence, unlike a list, any character in the sequence cannot be overwritten, nor can we insert or append characters to it unless we use certain string method that returns a new string object.</p>
<p>However, we can use one of the following tricks as a workaround to modify a string.</p>
<h2>Converting a String to a List</h2>
<p>Since both string and list objects are sequences, they are interconvertible. Hence, if we cast a string object to a list, modify the list either by insert(), append() or remove() methods and convert the list back to a string, to get back the modified version.</p>
<p>We have a string variable s1 with WORD as its value. With list() built-in function, let us convert it to a l1 list object, and insert a character L at index 3. The we use the join() method in str class to concatenate all the characters.</p>

<pre class="result notranslate">original string: WORD
['W', 'O', 'R', 'L', 'D']
Modified string: WORLD
</pre>
<h2>Using the Array Module</h2>
<p>To modify a string, construct an array object. Python standard library includes array module. We can have an array of Unicode type from a string variable.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token keyword">import</span> array <span class="token keyword">as</span> ar s1<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"WORD"</span> sar<span class="token operator">=</span>ar<span class="token punctuation">.</span>array<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">'u'</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> s1<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>Items in the array have a zero based index. So, we can perform array operations such as append, insert, remove etc. Let us insert L before the character D</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">sar<span class="token punctuation">.</span>insert<span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span><span class="token string">"L"</span><span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>Now, with the help of tounicode() method, get back the modified string</p>

<h2>Using the StringIO Class</h2>
<p>Python's io module defines the classes to handle streams. The StringIO class represents a text stream using an in-memory text buffer. A StringIO object obtained from a string behaves like a File object. Hence we can perform read/write operations on it. The getvalue() method of StringIO class returns a string.</p>
<p>Let us use this principle in the following program to modify a string.</p>

<h1>Python - String Concatenation</h1>
<p>The "+" operator is well-known as an addition operator, returning the sum of two numbers. However, the "+" symbol acts as string <strong>concatenation operator</strong> in Python. It works with two string operands, and results in the concatenation of the two.</p>
<p>The characters of the string on the right of plus symbol are appended to the string on its left. Result of concatenation is a new string.</p>

</pre>
<p>Another symbol *, which we normally use for multiplication of two numbers, can also be used with string operands. Here, * acts as a repetition operator in Python. One of the operands must be an integer, and the second a string. The operator concatenates multiple copies of the string. For example &minus;</p>
<pre class="result notranslate">&gt;&gt;&gt; "Hello"*3
'HelloHelloHello'
</pre>
<p>The integer operand is the number of copies of the string operand to be concatenated.</p>
<p>Both the string operators, (*) the repetition operator and (+) the concatenation operator, can be used in a single expression. The "*" operator has a higher precedence over the "+" operator.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">str1<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"Hello"</span> str2<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"World"</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"String 1:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>str1<span class="token punctuation">)</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"String 2:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>str2<span class="token punctuation">)</span> str3<span class="token operator">=</span>str1<span class="token operator">+</span>str2<span class="token operator">*</span><span class="token number">3</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"String 3:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span>str3<span class="token punctuation">)</span> str4<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token punctuation">(</span>str1<span class="token operator">+</span>str2<span class="token punctuation">)</span><span class="token operator">*</span><span class="token number">3</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span><span class="token string">"String 4:"</span><span class="token punctuation">,</span> str4<span class="token punctuation">)</span></div>
<p>To form <strong>str3</strong> string, Python concatenates 3 copies of World first, and then appends the result to Hello</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">String <span class="token number">3</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> HelloWorldWorldWorld</div>
<p>In the second case, the strings str1 and str2 are inside parentheses, hence their concatenation takes place first. Its result is then replicated three times.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false">String <span class="token number">4</span><span class="token punctuation">:</span> HelloWorldHelloWorldHelloWorld</div>
<p>Apart from + and *, no other arithmetic operator symbols can be used with string operands.</p>
<h1>Python - String Formatting</h1>
<p>String formatting is the process of building a string representation dynamically by inserting the value of numeric expressions in an already existing string. Python's string concatenation operator doesn't accept a non-string operand. Hence, Python offers following string formatting techniques &minus;</p>

<p><a href="/python/using_string_template_class.htm">Using String Template class</a></p>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>Python - Escape Characters</h1>
<p>In Python, a string becomes a raw string if it is prefixed with "r" or "R" before the quotation symbols. Hence 'Hello' is a normal string whereas r'Hello' is a raw string.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> normal<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"Hello"</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>normal<span class="token punctuation">)</span> Hello <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> raw<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">r"Hello"</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>raw<span class="token punctuation">)</span> Hello</div>
<p>In normal circumstances, there is no difference between the two. However, when the escape character is embedded in the string, the normal string actually interprets the escape sequence, whereas the raw string doesn't process the escape character.</p>
<div class="code-mirror  language-python" style="outline: none; overflow-wrap: break-word; overflow-y: auto; white-space: pre-wrap;" contenteditable="plaintext-only" spellcheck="false"><span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> normal<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">"Hello\nWorld"</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>normal<span class="token punctuation">)</span> Hello World <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> raw<span class="token operator">=</span><span class="token string">r"Hello\nWorld"</span> <span class="token operator">&gt;&gt;</span><span class="token operator">&gt;</span> <span class="token keyword">print</span> <span class="token punctuation">(</span>raw<span class="token punctuation">)</span> Hello\nWorld</div>
<p>In the above example, when a normal string is printed the escape character '\n' is processed to introduce a newline. However, because of the raw string operator 'r' the effect of escape character is not translated as per its meaning.</p>
<p>The newline character \n is one of the escape sequences identified by Python. Escape sequence invokes an alternative implementation character subsequence to "\". In Python, "\" is used as escape character. Following table shows list of escape sequences.</p>
<p>Unless an 'r' or 'R' prefix is present, escape sequences in string and bytes literals are interpreted according to rules similar to those used by Standard C. The recognized escape sequences are &minus;</p>

<h1>Python - String Methods</h1>
<p>Python's built-in <strong>str</strong> class defines different methods. They help in manipulating strings. Since string is an immutable object, these methods return a copy of the original string, performing the respective processing on it.</p>
<p>The string methods can be classified in following categories &minus;</p>
