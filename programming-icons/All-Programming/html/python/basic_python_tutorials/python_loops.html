<h2>Python Loops</h2>
<p>Python loops allow us to execute a statement or group of statements multiple times.</p>
<p>In general, statements are executed sequentially: The first statement in a function is executed first, followed by the second, and so on. There may be a situation when you need to execute a block of code several number of times.</p>
<p>Programming languages provide various control structures that allow for more complicated execution paths.</p>

<p>Repeats a statement or group of statements while a given condition is TRUE. It tests the condition before executing the loop body.</p>

<h2>Python Loop Control Statements</h2>
<p>Loop control statements change execution from its normal sequence. When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.</p>
<p>Python supports the following control statements. Click the following links to check their detail.</p>
<p>Let us go through the loop control statements briefly</p>

<p>Terminates the loop statement and transfers execution to the statement immediately following the loop.</p>

<tr>
<td class="ts">2</td>
<td><a title="continue statement in Python" href="/python/python_continue_statement.htm">continue statement</a>
<p>Causes the loop to skip the remainder of its body and immediately retest its condition prior to reiterating.</p>

<td class="ts">3</td>
<td><a title="pass statement in Python" href="/python/python_pass_statement.htm">pass statement</a>
<p>The pass statement in Python is used when a statement is required syntactically but you do not want any command or code to execute.</p>
