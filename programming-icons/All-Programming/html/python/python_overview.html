<p>Python is a high-level, interpreted, interactive and object-oriented scripting language. Python is designed to be highly readable. It uses English keywords frequently where as other languages use punctuation, and it has fewer syntactical constructions than other languages.</p>

<li><strong>Python is Interpreted</strong> &ndash; Python is processed at runtime by the interpreter.</li>
<li><strong>Python is Interactive</strong> &ndash; You can interact with the interpreter directly.</li>
<li><strong>Python is Object-Oriented</strong> &ndash; It supports object-oriented programming.</li>
<li><strong>Python is a Beginner's Language</strong> &ndash; Great for beginner-level programmers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Python is an open-source and cross-platform programming language. It is available for use under <strong>Python Software Foundation License</strong> (compatible to GNU General Public License) on all the major operating system platforms Linux, Windows and Mac OS.</p>
<p>To facilitate new features and to maintain that readability, the Python Enhancement Proposal (PEP) process was developed. This process allows anyone to submit a PEP for a new feature, library, or other addition.</p>
<p>The design philosophy of Python emphasizes on simplicity, readability and unambiguity. Python is known for its batteries included approach as Python software is distributed with a comprehensive standard library of functions and modules.</p>
<p>Python's design philosophy is documented in the <strong>Zen of Python</strong>. It consists of nineteen aphorisms such as &ndash;</p>
<div style="background-color: #f5f5f5; padding: 10px; border-radius: 4px;">
<ul style="margin: 0; padding-left: 20px;">
<li>Beautiful is better than ugly</li>
<li>Explicit is better than implicit</li>
<li>Simple is better than complex</li>
<li>Complex is better than complicated</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>To obtain the complete Zen of Python document, type <strong>import this</strong> in the Python Shell &ndash;</p>

Flat is better than nested.<br />
Sparse is better than dense.<br />
Readability counts.<br />
Special cases aren't special enough to <span style="color: #00ffff;">break</span> the rules.<br />
Although practicality beats purity.<br />
Errors should never <span style="color: #ff6666;">pass</span> silently.<br />
Unless explicitly silenced.<br />
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.<br />
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.<br />
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.<br />
Now is better than never.<br />
Although never is often better than <span style="color: #ffff66;">*right* now</span>.<br />
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.<br />
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
